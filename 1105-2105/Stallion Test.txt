It was a beautiful day in early summer when Javert at last had a chance to accept Delisle’s invitation.

They had taken a carriage to his country estate. They could have made the journey on horseback, but although surely Doré and Noiraude would have been happy for the exercise, Javert had thought it prudent to spare Valjean a journey back in the saddle.

By the time their carriage came to a halt in front of Delisle's mansion, Valjean had fallen silent, tense with nerves. 

They would only stay for the weekend. Furthermore, Valjean had already made the acquaintance of Raven, Delisle’s beautiful stallion, and had liked him well enough. Still, this was a first for both of them.

It was less public than the gathering of Delisle’s private club, where Javert had shown off Valjean to the discerning eyes of a small crowd and Valjean had stood still obediently despite his nerves as the judges touched him all over.

But that had been different: a public event, and one where they had been surrounded by other contestants. This was something else—a private invitation. It would be just Javert and Delisle. And while Javert rarely doubted himself, this time the sight of the impressive house with its sprawling meadows before him made him feel how out of his depth he truly was.

Valjean turned towards him, as if he could feel Javert’s doubt. “I won’t embarrass you, sir,” he said softly. “I’ll be good.”

Javert felt a smile tug on his lips. He knew Valjean would be good. Javert had worked hard enough to make sure of that. Valjean had learned manners—and had shown it beautifully at the gathering in Saint-Cloud.

“You better be,” Javert’s smile widened. Pointedly, he placed his riding crop across his lap and watched as heat rose to Valjean’s cheeks.

At the gathering, Javert had been forced to discipline Valjean before he’d even been able to take him out of the stable—although that had only partly been Valjean’s nerves, and part the red stallion’s provocation.

Javert hoped that this time, they’d be able to show Delisle just how well-trained Valjean truly was. Valjean’s surrender to him ran deeper than that of any plaything Delisle had ever brought to his mansion, even though Delisle would never know it.

***

They had been expected. As soon as the carriage came to a halt in the courtyard, a man opened the door of their carriage and welcomed them, taking the luggage Javert had brought for the weekend and guiding them to a room that was large and tastefully decorated, the windows overseeing a large garden stretching behind the house.

“There is a stall prepared in the stable for you, sir,” the man said once Javert’s luggage had been placed in his bedroom. “I can show you there now if you want to take the time to make your stallion comfortable. Monsieur Delisle will come and meet you in half an hour.”

By his side, Valjean had flushed, and Javert as well was taken aback at the realization that this man knew exactly what they’d come here for. But then, Delisle could hardly keep his preferences a secret. It was reassuring to know that they wouldn’t have to fear discovery from Delisle’s closest staff.

“Monsieur Delisle keeps only a handful of staff here during the summers,” the man explained as he led them back outside, as if he knew what Javert was thinking. “At this time of year, the mares and foals are out on our southern meadows—you might have seen the farmhouse on your journey here. That is where most of the work of running his estate is done. The manor only sees use when Monsieur Delisle needs a holiday from Paris or he invites his friends. So you need not fear any disruption. The staff that remains knows not to disturb Monsieur Delisle or his guests.”

Javert inclined his head, understanding what it was the man hadn’t said—that he knew exactly why Javert was here, that he knew what Valjean was to him, and that Javert didn’t need to fear exposure.

“Thank you,” Javert said. “It’s a beautiful house—and a beautiful garden, from what I’ve seen.”

“No doubt you will have a chance to explore it soon, sir.” The man smiled at him, then opened the door to the stable.

The stable was small—meant to hold only the master’s saddle-horses and a visiting carriage or two, no doubt, with Delisle’s broodmares and stallions stabled in the large farm they’d passed twenty minutes ago. The building was filled with light that fell in through high windows, illuminating generous stalls. The air was fragrant with the warm scent of hay, and the stall that had been prepared for Javert was large and clean, prepared with straw.

“I will have to excuse myself now,” the man said, “and see to the preparation of this evening’s dinner. Monsieur Delisle will be with you in half an hour. Please make yourself at home, sir. My master says that if you lack any equipment, his tack room over there is at your disposal.”

That was an offer Javert had a hard time resisting, and as soon as they found themselves left alone, he turned towards Valjean and nodded towards the tack room with a smile.

“Let’s see if you can find something you like,” he said.

Javert had carried the riding crop with him—a piece of quality work which Valjean had selected and purchased himself, well aware that it would be used on him instead of their horses. 

The leather was smooth and soft with use, the grip fitting perfectly into Javert’s hand. Even now, after Valjean had been with him in Paris for almost three years and Javert had tried out a multitude of implements on Valjean’s hide, the crop remained his favorite tool. He liked the way it felt in his hand, he liked the way Valjean’s eyes would return to it again and again when Javert carried it with him—and he liked the lines it left on Valjean’s luscious, round backside, as decorative as they were painful.

Still, having a favorite tool didn’t mean that Javert wasn’t curious how another man handled his own stallion. And a man of such wealth and taste as Delisle was certain to have a collection that would dwarf anything Javert had collected for his amusement.

The tack room did not disappoint. Much of it was obviously in use by Delisle’s real horses: saddles, bridles, harnesses, ropes and brushes, all of them gleaming, clean and well-oiled.

The tack room was large. To Javert’s right, an open door led to another chamber. It was a door that could be locked, but today was left ajar. No doubt the key would be turned and hidden when the wrong sort of person came to pay Delisle a visit—but today, for the occasion of Javert’s visit, the mysterious door had been thrown wide open in invitation.

Javert smiled, intrigued. Was it a desire to impress, or perhaps mere hospitality? They would find out soon enough, he thought and nodded at Valjean, who was the first to enter.

The second tack room was nearly as large as the first. Here, too, polished leather gleamed—but the bridles hanging on the wall were not of a shape that would fit the head of any horse, and the variety of whips and crops would have made Javert seriously doubt Delisle’s horsemanship.

It was that wall that drew Valjean. Javert watched, amused, as Valjean gazed at the whips. To speak the truth, Javert couldn’t quite imagine Delisle wielding one of these. He’d seen Raven’s back, after all, and his skin had been smooth and unmarred while a few of the whips displayed were certain to yield scars much like those that crisscrossed Valjean’s back.

Was that what had drawn Valjean to this wall?

“You’ve never used one of those on me, sir,” Valjean said quietly.

Javert tilted his head. He didn’t answer at first, watching as Valjean began to reach out for a curled, cruel length of leather, then flinched away at the last moment.

He could have said many things in return—You never gave me a reason to, for example, which was true enough.

But that wasn’t the whole truth. Javert had often used crop or belt for no reason other than wanting to see Valjean’s backside quiver, or because he was in a bad mood and Valjean’s tears were an easy cure.

“Would you want me to?” was what he said at last.

Valjean was silent for a long moment, still staring at the whip—scared, or fascinated, or perhaps both.

“I don’t know,” he admitted at last.

“No need to think about it this weekend,” Javert said gently. “That’s not what I brought you here for. You’re here to entertain me and our host.”

Valjean exhaled and then nodded, accepting the answer without argument, which would not have happened a few years ago. Then he moved on, his gaze running over an assortment of riding crops of varying lengths, and then various paddles.

“Look at this,” Javert said, admiration and sudden want kindling inside him as he inspected a set of bridle and harness that looked familiar.

It was what Raven had worn the day when he had won the championship. Soft calfskin polished to a honey-gold shine, the steel bar of the bit gleaming as if it had been newly forged—and beneath the bridle and harness, a glorious tail hung, raven-black hair attached to a plug of smooth, shiny mahogany.

Valjean reached out—almost shyly—and drew his fingers over the buttery leather.

“It’s beautiful.” Valjean turned to look at Javert, his mouth twisting into the wide smile that had become such a familiar sight over the past few years. “But not as beautiful as your harness, sir.”

Javert had worried, at first, when he’d been asked to infiltrate the private club of other such enthusiasts. He was painfully aware of his own standing, and although the position of the prefecture’s chief inspector was more than Javert had ever dreamed of having as a young man, he’d keenly felt the gulf dividing him from the other men attending with their stallions. While many bridles had been studded with gleaming gems, Javert had carved and polished the wood for Valjean’s tail himself.

But when it came down to it, Javert’s own simple harness suited Valjean. And when Valjean wore it, he shone without jewels, decorated with obedience and the breathless, yearning way with which he surrendered himself.

Another wall lined with shelves held various dildos and plugs, and yet another chains and shackles and ropes. Javert surveyed it all, satisfaction and jealousy still warring within him when he compared the room to the small chest of toys he had at his own disposal at home—without Valjean’s harness, it would all fit into a drawer of his nightstand.

One dildo stood out even in this collection. It had been crafted in the likeness of a stallion’s erect cock, as thick and long as Javert’s arm. It was this toy that had caught Valjean’s attention, who was staring at it with equal parts dread and fascination.

Javert stepped closer to examine it as well. It was thicker than Javert’s wrist—but not as thick as his fist. Valjean could take it, though they had not worked up to such a depth of penetration yet.

Looking at Valjean from the corner of his eye, Javert took hold of the enormous phallus and stroked it thoughtfully.

It was not made of wood. There was a little give, the phallus soft and smooth—not unlike an erect cock. Smooth, stretched leather, he thought—not wood. That would make it easier for Valjean to take.

“You like this one?” he said. “I’ll keep it in mind.”

Valjean’s eyes were still riveted to the enormous length. He swallowed at Javert’s words.

“Surely no one could, sir...” Valjean’s voice sounded shaky, though Javert knew him well enough to know that it wasn’t from fear. “It’s too big.”

Javert ran his hand over the phallus again, stroking down from the tip. Then he shook his head.

“You can take it.”

Valjean shivered, his eyes still on Javert’s hand. This time, he remained silent. Javert imagined him stretched out, his limbs tied and his hole revealed to their audience, red and swollen, as the enormous cock sank so deep inside him that Valjean couldn’t take it without tears.

“But I’m not going to ruin your hole before we’ve met our hosts,” Javert said, his smile widening a little. “That would be rather impolite, don’t you think?”

Valjean swallowed again and looked up at him. “Will you let Raven fuck me, sir?”

Poor Valjean didn’t know what the plan was, although the idea had formed in Javert’s mind as soon as he’d seen Raven lovingly fuck Valjean to orgasm in front of an audience. Raven had been skillful and affectionate, his performance breathtaking, focused more on Valjean’s pleasure than his own. It was a skill Valjean lacked so far.

“Is that what you’re worried about?” Javert laughed softly. “Or perhaps it’s what you’re hoping for?”

An anxious line formed around Valjean’s mouth, his eyes uncertain. Was he afraid that Javert was testing him?

“There’s no correct answer to that question,” Javert said, amused. “Because it doesn’t matter, does it? If I want him to fuck you, you’ll let him.”

Valjean inclined his head, and Javert reached out to curve his hand around his nape, letting it rest there, heavy and reassuring.

“I think it’s time we stopped exploring and got you ready. That will settle your nerves.”

“Yes, sir,” Valjean said, and then he leaned in to brush his lips against Javert’s and kissed him, sweetly asking for reassurance in a way that never failed to move Javert.

Javert buried his fingers in Valjean’s hair and drew him close, sliding his tongue deep into Valjean’s mouth until Valjean moaned and relaxed in his arms, eyes closed, his nerves forgotten.

“Come,” Javert said when he pulled back, breathless and smiling. “Or they’ll find us still here when they return. I want you looking your best.”

This time, Valjean followed Javert into his stall as obediently as Valjean’s own Spanish gelding, stripping off his clothes at Javert’s command and holding still when Javert began to rub oil into his skin.

This wasn’t new, either—Javert had prepared Valjean just like that for the trials in Saint-Cloud. But now they were no longer among fellow enthusiasts at an event dedicated to showing off a plethora of stallions. Right now, they were all alone in another man’s stable, and although they’d been promised that no one would disturb them, Javert still found himself listening for sounds in the quiet building, uncertain how he’d react should one of Delisle’s stable hands enter.

Valjean looked beautiful in the golden summer sunshine that filled the stable. His bare body gleamed with oil, hard with muscle. He truly was an impressive sight, as powerful as the massive white fire horses he took care of during the week.

Valjean’s cock had already begun to harden, and Javert quickly smoothed the large steel ring into place around the base of his cock and his balls. 

The sensation made Valjean groan, but he held still for it, even when Javert’s hand returned to thoughtfully close around his swollen balls, weighing them.

It had been two weeks since he’d last allowed Valjean to come. It hadn’t been good for Valjean’s temper, despite Valjean’s efforts to control himself these days, and Javert had been forced to use the crop to correct his manners more often than he usually had to.

Still, Valjean had remained unfulfilled, his balls now heavy and swollen in Javert’s hand.

Javert patted Valjean’s backside, then let go of him, ignoring the pitiful sound Valjean made.

“Turn around.”

Valjean knew what was to come. With a deep breath, he leaned slightly forward and spread his legs. Javert watched admiringly before he retrieved the tail he’d brought.

It was the same tail they’d used at the trials: the wood polished by Javert himself, the tail made of genuine, silver horse hair that fell past Valjean’s knees and swished as he walked with the plug inside him.

Javert had been generous with the oil; the plug slid in easily, although Valjean hissed and rose to his toes to escape the pressure.

Javert smiled as he watched Valjean tremble. He could only imagine the pressure in his balls, Valjean’s cock now hard and red. Javert’s plan seemed to be working well.

“Don’t even think of finding release,” he said. “If I catch you touching yourself...”

Panting, Valjean hastily shook his head, his eyes wide and wild—already overwhelmed by sensation although they had barely started.

Javert smoothed his hand over a buttock again, kneading the firm flesh.

“Turn around,” he said. “Let me see you walk.”

Valjean walked back and forth in his small stall, his painfully swollen cock bobbing in the air. 

“Beautiful,” a deep voice suddenly said from the corridor behind them.

When Javert turned around, he saw that their host had arrived. Delisle wore a dark red hunting coat, in his hand a pair of reins, loosely held.

Behind him stood Raven, the dark-haired stallion perhaps twenty years his junior, with soft, slightly curly hair, his skin a warm, golden olive, as if he’d spent lots of time in the summer sun. Like Valjean, he was wearing a tail.

Raven’s tail was black just like his hair, whereas the harness he wore today was made from soft, brown leather and polished steel, unlike the showy harness and bridle he’d worn at the competition.

Despite Delisle’s hold on his reins, Raven eagerly strode forward. Delisle gave him his head with a laugh.

“It’s been a while since he had company,” he said. “And he rather liked that fine stallion of yours.”

Javert hadn’t yet put a bridle on Valjean, and for a moment, he couldn’t help but remember Valjean’s reaction to the aggressive, red stallion who had cornered them in the stable before the trials. But while Valjean still seemed a little alarmed when Raven moved straight towards him, he held himself still and at Javert’s signal, warily came forward.

“None of your tricks now,” Javert told Valjean and gave his thigh a light, warning tap with the crop. “Be nice to our hosts.”

Knowing Valjean, the problem was that Raven was too nice. Valjean didn’t know how to react to that. Still, Javert’s warning was enough to make Valjean hold still when Raven came closer, and once Raven had eagerly rubbed his cheek against Valjean’s shoulder and breathed against his cheek, Valjean relaxed a little—perhaps remembering how good Raven had made him feel last year.

“Shall we let them get to know each other again?” Delisle asked, reaching out to lightly thread his fingers through Valjean’s hair, gently stroking him.

Valjean exhaled with a surprised huff of air, but held still for it, although he was watching Delisle cautiously as well.

“After that long journey, he must want to stretch his legs.” Delisle’s hand released Valjean’s hair at last to stroke down his chest, feeling his muscle. “He seems in fine form.”

Valjean shifted uncertainly, only to immediately flush and stand still before Javert even had to remind him—the pressure of the plug alone sufficed for that.

“Do I need to put a bridle on you?” Javert asked quietly. “Or will you behave yourself?”

Valjean looked up at him, still uncertain, but then seemed to come to a decision and lowered his head in submission.

Javert smiled and, instead of the bridle, simply attached a lead to his harness. 

Delisle took them to a meadow surrounded by a hedge, hidden behind the mansion and far from the eyes of any casual observer. Delisle truly had arranged things very well—was all of this just a diversion he indulged in every now and then when he invited a friend from his club, or did he and Raven spend much of their time here?

Javert took off the lead and set Valjean free in the small meadow. The grass stood high, fragrant with wild flowers, the ground soft. At the far end of the meadow, trees arched over the hedge, offering shade beneath the branches.

“Behave,” Delisle said, laughing, Raven already champing at the bit when he saw Valjean take his first, hesitant steps into the meadow, silver tail brushing against the long grass.

“Don’t scare him.”

Raven snorted playfully in answer, looking as if he was very much enjoying himself. Delisle reached out to open a buckle and gently took off the bridle, easing the bit out of his mouth.

Javert watched Raven stalk straight towards Valjean, who seemed torn between his desire to be good or to flee from handsome, affectionate Raven whose attentions he’d always found overwhelming, even when Javert had kept a firm hold on his reins.

Now, Valjean watched warily, taking an instinctive step back before he caught himself.

“He’s so shy,” Delisle said in delight. “Raven, behave!”

Javert felt a smile tugging on his own lips. Valjean, hard muscles gleaming in the sunlight, exuded an almost brutal strength. He wouldn’t have seemed out of place in a collection of Roman statues; all he lacked was a spear and a shield.

Raven was very handsome, his body firm with muscle, a man in his thirties, graceful and athletic, who was no doubt used to long hours in the saddle or perhaps the fencing school. Next to Jean Valjean, there was no doubt at all who was the stronger and who should feel threatened.

Still, Raven moved straight towards Valjean, every step exuding confidence and eager curiosity, and Valjean would surely have chosen to flee if he hadn’t wanted to please Javert.

“I’ve been looking forward to seeing these two play together again,” Delisle said. “What a pretty picture they make.”

Raven had now reached Valjean and was circling him in delight, pausing once to bury his nose in Valjean’s hair and scent along his nape before he playfully bared his teeth and bit Valjean, just like a horse trying to exert dominance.

Valjean flinched and made a shocked sound, but Raven had already danced out of his reach, tail swishing against his thighs while Valjean still watched him in confusion.

Javert watched, amused. The sight should have been hilarious—and yet, how often did he have a chance to admire Valjean’s naked body in the sunlight, surrounded by green grass and flowering trees?

Javert leaned against the fence and smiled at Valjean, who’d turned to give him a helpless look. Finding no help from Javert, Valjean turned back to face Raven when the other stallion mischievously came closer again.

This time, Valjean was prepared and moved out of the way just when Raven teasingly leaned in to nip at him once more. Perhaps he’d assumed that Valjean would challenge him in return—but Valjean wasn’t used to such a playful companion. Instead he stood waiting, confused and uncertain, while Raven kept approaching and teasing him until at long last, minutes later, Valjean finally seemed to understand Raven’s invitation and began to hesitantly run after him.

“There. That’s more like it,” Delisle said with a laugh. “Raven always gets his way in the end. I know I spoil him… But can you blame me? “

It was a charming sight to watch the two stallions running together, bare skin gleaming in the sunlight. Raven was no doubt very handsome, but Javert couldn’t look away from Valjean, who had finally lost all inhibition. It was a rare sight indeed to see Valjean abandoning his fears just like that.

It had been the right choice to come. Even if Javert would never be able to compete with Delisle’s mansion and his tack room, it was worth anything to watch Valjean let go and allow himself to play.

Once the two men had run until they were breathless, they returned to their owners. A light sheen of sweat was visible on Valjean’s body now, his hair tousled by the wind, an uncharacteristic smile on his face as he looked at Javert.

Javert reached into his pocket and fished out a treat, but when he held it out to Valjean, it was Raven who shouldered him aside playfully and hastily took the sugar cube from Javert’s palm, eyes laughing up at him while Valjean watched, stunned and unhappy.

“You’re spoiled indeed,” Javert said dryly and reached out to bury his hand in Raven’s hair, giving his head a little shake. “If you were mine, my riding crop would see a lot of exercise.”

Raven made a shocked little sound—this time, Valjean had at last dared to come forward and nipped at his shoulder while giving him an indignant look.

“None of your sullenness.” Javert released Raven at last to turn back to Valjean with a stern look. “Come here.”

Valjean reluctantly came closer, his eyes on Javert’s riding crop—expecting, no doubt, to find himself pushed against the fence for a few swats.

Instead, Javert curved his hand around his neck and held him in a tight grip, and after a few moments, he felt Valjean relax.

Only then did he reach into his pocket for another treat, offering it to Valjean who took it from his palm with soft, hot lips, the tip of his tongue swiping gently, apologetically, against Javert’s palm.

When they returned at last, later that afternoon, the stable was still quiet, now filled by the warm light of the afternoon sun. Someone had already seen to the horses and left once more; the corridor was clean, not a single piece of straw out of place, the handful of horses stabled there busy with the hay they’d received.

Valjean had recovered from his hour of playing in the meadow. Raven had kept him on his toes—but Javert had to admit that Delisle had been right. Seeing the two stallions play together had been a delightful picture.

Now, though, after an hour of wearing the plug the tail was fastened to, it had become visibly harder for Valjean to bear the constant stimulation. After two weeks of no release, every fiber in Valjean’s body seemed to be quivering with need, close to the breaking point. Even when Javert soothingly ran his hand down his body, Valjean shivered again. He knew better than to dare to touch himself, but he tried to press himself against Javert, miserably erect, his balls heavy and swollen when Javert fingered them.

Javert smiled and then withdrew to take hold of the bridle. Valjean watched him woefully, but when Javert held out the bit on his palm, Valjean willingly took it into his mouth and allowed Javert to fasten the leather straps around his head.

It was the same bridle he’d used at the competition, with blinkers of leather next to Valjean’s eyes that severely restricted his field of view.

With the iron bit in his mouth, Valjean couldn’t speak even if he’d wanted. It only took the lightest tug on a rein to have Valjean respond immediately and follow Javert, who led him around a corner to the far end of the stable, where Delisle was already waiting.

This was the event Javert had long been looking forward to—ever since the events at the private club’s championship had first put the idea into his mind.

Now, with Valjean champing at the bit, his body almost vibrating with long frustrated need and his cock painfully erect, dripping wetness at every step, Javert led him up to where Raven had been tied in place.

Two chains hooked into the rings of Raven’s bridle and tied him to the bars of the stalls on either side of him. Fresh straw had been spread on the ground. He was kneeling on it on his hands and knees, his backside towards them, the plug with the black tail still inside him.

Valjean was able to catch a glimpse of him despite his blinkers when Javert led him straight towards Raven, and Javert could feel the shiver that ran through Valjean. Valjean knew that something was up—he just didn’t know what exactly yet.

Amused, Javert patted Valjean’s back and loosely tied him to a bar while he went up to where Delisle was waiting for him.

“I’m eager to see him perform,” Delisle said, eying Valjean with appreciation. “I was impressed by him at the trials. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a stronger stallion. Look at the muscle on him!”

Javert turned to gaze at Valjean critically, but could find little to criticize himself. “He has a bit of a temper,” he said, idly slapping his riding crop against his boot, “but he learns well enough. He did well last year. I was proud of him that day.”

“And his first time at a show, too.” Delisle reached down to lightly tousle Raven’s hair.

Javert’s eyes were still on Valjean, who’d made use of the give in his reins to turn nervously, his eyes on them despite the blinkers.

“He was skittish around the other stallions,” Javert said. “He isn’t used to them. Which is why I’m grateful for this opportunity.”

“Oh, the pleasure is all mine.” Delisle laughed. “He is lovely. I’m curious how he’ll perform. You said he has little experience?”

“None,” Javert said quietly, still looking at Valjean who was gazing back at him from dark eyes—not certain what it was that would be demanded of him, still wary and ill at ease, and yet very much aware that he was Javert’s and would do whatever Javert demanded of him today, no matter what.

“I know he’ll try his best not to disappoint me, but it might take a while,” Javert said.

Delisle’s eyes had followed Javert’s and were now lingering on Valjean’s cock. “He looks eager enough. I think he’ll take to it very quickly.”

“He should be. It’s been two weeks for him.”

Valjean shifted uncomfortably at Javert’s word, his achingly erect cock exposed to them, already swollen to a dark, bruised red.

Valjean was good at controlling himself. There hadn’t been a single accident in the past two weeks. And although Valjean’s temper had suffered a little, Javert’s belt had taken care of that, and Valjean’s balls had remained achingly full—awaiting this day, although Valjean hadn’t known that.

“Then let’s see how he performs.”

Delisle moved, and Raven’s legs eagerly spread at his touch. Javert watched as Delisle eased out the plug—smaller than the one he’d chosen for Valjean, although Raven’s hole had swollen to a becoming pink, slightly puffy, a trickle of oil dripping from the convulsing muscle when the plug was at last pulled free.

Javert untied Valjean and kept a tight grip on his reins, noting the way Valjean trembled, his cock bobbing in the air with every step he took. No wonder Delisle had made certain to prepare Raven well. He must have feared that Valjean might make it fast and brutal.

But there was little chance of that, with Javert keeping a tight grip on Valjean’s reins. He’d starved Valjean’s body of pleasure for a reason, after all—he wanted him eager, and although it might have been an alluring sight to see handsome, confident Raven used brutally by a frenzied stallion, Valjean was skittish enough that Javert was afraid it might take effort to get him to perform at all.

Valjean had realized by now why Javert had brought him here, but even so he followed along willingly, his eyes uncertain and pleading until Javert lightly trailed his hand through his hair again before resting it heavily against his nape.

“You’re going to service another stallion today, and you’ll do it well, do you understand me?”

Valjean shivered, his bridle jingling when he lowered his head in submission after a long moment.

Javert led him up to Raven, then pointed at the floor and watched as Valjean obediently fell to his knees.

“Go on,” Javert said, leaving the reins loose and moving to stand next to Delisle.

Valjean was breathing heavily, looking unsure of himself. He turned his head until he could see Javert in the small field of view his blinkers allowed him, his throat moving a little as if he wanted to speak, although the bit in his mouth made that impossible.

 Javert raised his arm and gave Valjean’s backside a light, encouraging slap with the riding crop that made Valjean shiver, his heavy cock jerking.

“You know what to do.”

Valjean exhaled heavily, then turned back, his bridle jingling as he hesitantly began to cover Raven with his body. Raven was ready for him, and Valjean was rock-hard—it had been two weeks for him, and with the ring Javert had forced around his cock and balls, there was no danger of him softening anytime soon.

Still, Valjean was hesitant despite his body’s eagerness, and when his cock brushed against Raven’s buttocks, he shivered again, making a soft, vulnerable sound despite the iron in his mouth.

Delisle laughed softly. “He’s so charming. Does he need assistance?”

Javert’s lips twitched with amusement. “He knows where it goes.”

He touched his crop to Valjean’s backside again—a gentle touch of encouragement rather than a slap, and Valjean shuddered and moved over Raven with a groan, his cock nudging at Raven’s hole.

Raven shifted beneath him, pushing back against Valjean—but Valjean was clumsy with inexperience and hesitance, his cock rubbing up and down Raven’s crease several times before he at last managed to find his hole.

Raven, at least, was experienced enough, his hole slick and stretched, and Raven himself hungry for it so that he pushed back and they could watch Raven’s pink, eager hole spread wide and suck the tip of Valjean’s cock inside.

That, it seemed, was all the encouragement Valjean needed before instinct won over. His hips bucked forward with an overwhelmed groan breaking free from his lips, the massive, red cock sinking into Raven’s hole to the root with one hard thrust.

Beneath him, Raven threw back his head in shock, moaning in turn. Valjean’s entire body trembled as he thrust into the welcoming heat once, twice—and then he collapsed over Raven’s back, groaning helplessly as his tormented balls emptied themselves inside Raven.

“That was hardly a performance worthy of you.”

This time, Javert let his crop come down with more force, the short, broad length of leather at the tip hitting Valjean’s swollen balls.

Despite the iron bit in his mouth, Valjean cried out, panting as he collapsed on top of Raven who endured it patiently.

Javert gave Valjean’s reins a warning tug and watched as Valjean miserably retreated. Despite his release, his cock was still hard and swollen thanks to the ring Javert had put on him.

Raven shifted impatiently. Some of Valjean’s seed came dripping from his reddened hole, but unlike Valjean he held obediently still, although he couldn’t have derived much satisfaction from Valjean’s performance.

Javert raised the crop again. This time, he used it to warningly caress Valjean’s buttocks, the leather gliding across damp skin in threat. He allowed Valjean a few minutes of recovery, watching as he panted against the pain, his balls now a pretty, dark red.

“Again,” Javert said. “Do better this time.”

He tapped his crop against Valjean’s thigh and Valjean moved forward, lining up his cock with Raven’s hole once more.

Raven made an eager, encouraging sound, pushing back against him as Valjean leaned over him. Once again Valjean slid inside to the root right with the first thrust and cried out helplessly, his entire body shaking as his hips snapped back and forward instinctively before he managed to control himself.

It was a very pretty sight. Valjean’s legs were trembling, all the muscles of his body contracting. He manged to hold out for a long moment, his cock deep inside Raven who moaned in encouragement. When Valjean finally began to thrust again, he managed to keep his rhythm slow for a few thrusts—but then he faltered once more, spilling himself uncontrollably. 

Almost immediately, Javert let his crop come down once more, two hard, furious stripes springing up on Valjean’s buttocks while Valjean still shivered through his release.

With a harsh tug on the reins, Javert pulled him off Raven once more, the last spurt of his come hitting Raven’s exposed, pink hole, dripping down his crease while Raven shifted.

“No,” Javert said again, then nudged Valjean’s sensitive, swollen balls with the crop until Valjean groaned. “You’re not too old to have these removed if you can’t learn to behave yourself.”

“He certainly has a lot of pent-up energy,” Delisle said with a soft laugh. “Poor Raven. It’s not nice to tease him so.”

“He hasn’t come in two weeks,” Javert said, “and if he keeps this up, he’s certainly not going to come in the next two months. Again!”

Valjean’s cock was still achingly hard, the ring keeping him from softening. This time, when he shakily moved forward to cover Raven, Valjean made a desperate sound when his cock rubbed against Raven’s crease, hesitating for a moment before he pressed against the loose, dripping hole and slid right inside.

Javert tapped Valjean’s reddened backside with the crop.

“Fuck him,” he said. “And do it seriously. This is no way to treat our hosts.”

Valjean was gasping for air. His sweat ran in glistening drops down his powerful body, all the muscles in his body tensing as he tried to control himself.

This time, Raven was moaning, clearly enjoying himself as Valjean began moving inside him, Valjean’s powerful thighs as hard as knotted rope as he tried to hold back.

It was a beautiful sight. For once, Valjean managed to keep going for several deep, slow thrusts until Raven began pushing back against him, arching his back as fluid began to drip from his own, eager cock—and then Valjean once again collapsed on top of him, sobbing in agony as his hips snapped forward, fucking Raven’s wet hole and spurting his release deep inside him for a third time.

Before he’d finished, Javert’s crop came down once more, adding another red line to the stripes that already adorned Valjean’s backside before he pulled him off Raven.

Panting miserably, Valjean retreated, Raven’s hole gaping open and quivering as white trickles of come dripped down his thighs.

“Again,” Javert said coldly. He used his crop to lift Valjean’s cock, which was still miserably hard, swollen a dark red. “Raven treated you so well—and now look at how you treat him in turn. Again.”

Valjean’s cheeks were wet with tears when his cock slid inside Raven once more. His red buttocks clenched as breathless, pitiful sobs escaped him at every tentative thrust. Javert gave his thighs an encouraging slap with the crop, and Valjean shuddered and sobbed and buried himself in Raven to the root. He had to be so sensitive now that the tight, hot clutch of Raven around him had to be more pain than pleasure—but still Valjean obeyed, wet with sweat and shaking all over as he fucked him with slow, deep thrusts, every muscle visible in deep relief as he labored.

“That’s more like it,” Delisle said. “See, he likes it.”

Raven was indeed at last getting what he needed. He was tossing his handsome, dark-haired head, arching his back beneath Valjean and pushing back into him, his cock dripping at every motion. With each thrust, Raven moaned, and Valjean kept steadily sliding in and out—a beautiful picture, as beautiful as when Raven had taken Valjean that day at the competition and won the trophy for his performance.

Valjean kept going, exquisite in his torment, fucking Raven with all the strength of a steam-powered engine while Raven writhed beneath him.

“Remember how good he made you feel,” Javert said. “Show some manners. Make him come first. You’re not here to be selfish—you’re here to make him feel good.”

Another warning tap with the crop followed, but it seemed that at last, the warning wasn’t needed. Although Valjean’s chest was heaving and it seemed like he could barely draw breath, he kept fucking Raven with slow, deep strokes, this time managing to resist temptation and keep going, again and again and again.

“Does he even have anything left in him at this point?” Delisle asked with a laugh. “He might have no manners, but he does have stamina.”

“Look at those balls,” Javert said. “He has enough left to keep going for a while.”

“Oh, Raven will enjoy that,” Delisle murmured and reached down to affectionately tousle Raven’s locks. Raven moaned again and leaned into his touch, trembling when Valjean never faltered in his thrusts.

Javert had wondered whether a day would be enough, after how spectacularly Valjean had failed at this task at first—but it did seem that at long last, he’d managed to learn how to control himself.

Even though he was visibly shaking from the effort of keeping a tight grip on himself, Valjean kept taking Raven with deep, slow thrusts. Valjean’s sore cock slid in and out of the reddened hole already dripping with his own come, until at last, long minutes later, it was Raven who moaned helplessly and trembled, his own release spurting against his stomach in pulse after pulse as Valjean fucked him even through that, every thrust just as deep and certain.

“Well done,” Javert said and reached out to pat a sweaty buttock. “Now you can come.”

With a desperate groan, Valjean pushed forward once more, swollen balls slapping against Raven’s sweaty skin when he finally began to spill himself a fourth time inside him. From the sounds Valjean made, this time release was more pain than pleasure, his entire body trembling as if he had barely enough strength left to keep himself upright.

Javert laughed softly when he finally pulled Valjean back by the reins. Raven’s hole was a mess, puffy and sore and dripping come all the way down his thighs—and Valjean looked no better, his cock dark red, balls swollen and purple.

“Well done,” Javert said again, burying his fingers in Valjean’s hair. “There. You finally made him feel good. I knew you could learn.”

Valjean’s eyes were so wide they looked black, his gaze unfocused, riveted to Javert as he panted for breath. His cheeks were wet with tears, saliva dripping from his lips. The bridle kept him from speaking—but even without it, Javert doubted that he’d still be able to form words.

Javert smiled as he curved his hand around Valjean’s cheek.

“Let’s get you cleaned up,” he said tenderly. “You look a mess.”

The stable had been prepared—no doubt by the man who had led them here before leaving them to their amusement. Buckets of warm water stood nearby, soft cloths and towels at the ready.

Javert patiently washed Valjean’s body, leaving the bridle in for now. Valjean’s body quivered helplessly when Javert reached out for his cock, and Javert had to apply more oil before at last he managed to work the steel ring from Valjean’s sore balls and cock. A pained sound escaped from behind the bit, and Javert dipped the cloth into cold water before he spread it over Valjean sore genitals.

Only then did he reach out for the fastenings of the bridle, gently easing the metal bit out of Valjean’s mouth.

Valjean was panting, gazing up at him from wide, dark eyes, the corners of his mouth reddened. Javert slid two fingers into his mouth, probing along his lips and teeth and tongue to see that no harm had come to him, and Valjean moaned around his fingers, trying to suck on them.

Valjean really had given it his all, sinking so deep into the game that even now he was all helpless, yielding surrender. Javert felt overcome by a wave of deepest tenderness and fiercest possessiveness, curving his hand around Valjean’s face as he kissed him deeply, their hosts forgotten for a moment.

“You’ve been so good today,” he whispered against Valjean’s lips. “So very good.”

Delisle left them to rest for a while, afterward—Raven took far less time to recover than Valjean, his eyes warm with affection as he and Delisle took their leave.

“Take as much time as you want,” Delisle told Javert. “I’ll see that you are undisturbed in here, and that your rooms are readied for you.”

They lingered for a while. The stable was very quiet now. It was just the two of them, surrounded by the warm scent of fresh hay and straw, Valjean’s chest heaving as Javert slowly wiped away sweat and oil with a damp cloth.

When Valjean’s limbs were no longer trembling, they retreated to the room that had been prepared for them. Steam was rising from a waiting bathtub, and Javert watched with pleasure as Valjean’s powerful body was bared to him once more before he sank into the hot water.

Valjean was still very quiet, his eyes lingering on Javert even as he relaxed in the luxurious bath, and Javert in turn couldn’t take his eyes off him.

“Look at you,” Javert said quietly, seating himself next to the tub and dipping an arm into the hot water perfumed with oils.

Javert drew his fingers up Valjean’s gleaming chest before he leaned in again to kiss him once more, Valjean moaning into the kiss.

Javert’s lips quirked. “You’ve had quite some exercise today. We’ll have to leave that ring off for the rest of the day.”

It had been worth it to make Valjean wait for two weeks. He was certain Valjean would agree—although perhaps not right now, when he was still so overwhelmed and trembly from the long, delicious torture.

“Raven must be well pleased to have had you at last.”

At this, Valjean flushed, and Javert laughed. There was a true sign that Valjean was returning to himself.

“You’ll see him for dinner in two hours,” he chided lightly. “Surely you haven’t forgotten that?”

Valjean swallowed. When he raised his eyes to Javert again, he looked hesitant. “Did I—I didn’t hurt him, did I?”

“Is that what you’re worried about?” Javert gave Valjean an affectionate look and reached out to run his wet fingers through his hair.

Of course Valjean would be worried. It was one of the reasons he’d kept him without relief for two weeks. Valjean’s control was a beautiful thing—but a stallion too shy to go about his work would have pleased no one, least of all Raven.

“Raven looked well pleased,” Javert said and laughed. “You can ask him yourself this evening if he liked it.”

The thought made Valjean flush again, and he turned away to gaze worriedly at the water.

“It was a beautiful sight,” Javert murmured, running his fingers back down until they encountered a small nipple. “I was well pleased. That should be enough for you.”

“It is, sir,” Valjean said immediately—but even so, there was a small, worried frown on his brow.

It wouldn’t last long, Javert knew that. If there was one thing Delisle’s delightful young stallion was good at, it was lightening Valjean’s sombre mood—and he had no doubt that Raven had enjoyed himself, perhaps even more than any of them.

Valjean would find that out soon enough, and then there was all of tonight and the entire next day to further explore Delisle’s tack room and make use of meadows and stables.

“Maybe I’ll let you make it up to him with your mouth,” Javert said lightly, rewarded by the way a tremor ran through Valjean. “Would you like that? I think you would.”

Valjean swallowed. “What about you, sir?” he ventured.

Javert felt himself suddenly overcome by a strange tenderness as he looked down at Valjean sprawled in his bath.

“That is what you’re worried about, isn’t it?” he murmured in understanding. “Never fear. I intend to make good use of you tonight. Even if I doubt that you’ll get much out of it after that performance just now. I doubt that even Raven’s lovely mouth could get you hard again today.”

Valjean shivered, reaching out for Javert, and Javert let himself be pulled into a desperate kiss, ignoring the wetness of Valjean’s skin.

“I want it regardless,” Valjean whispered against his skin. “It will be good anyway. Because of it. It’s all I want—”

“I know,” Javert said softly, cupping Valjean’s cheek in his hand and stroking him with the pad of his thumb. “I know. And you’ll have it. All of me. More of me than you can take.”

“Impossible,” Valjean said with a sigh, a small smile tugging on his lips as he relaxed back into the steaming water at last.

“We’ll see about that.” Javert found himself helplessly smiling in return. “It’s going to be a long weekend for you.”

“A good weekend,” Valjean said with quiet determination, and Javert couldn’t help but agree.
