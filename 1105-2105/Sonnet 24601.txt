Shall I compare you to a pinch of snuff?
You are more soothing, more desirable;
Rough crooks can make my workday far more tough
And Chabouillet's demands are undeniable;
Sometimes the shades of Toulon loom too dark,
And often guilt and shame will fill my soul
Beholding how the lashes left their mark
On you, who never earned a fate so foul;
But your eternal fairness shall not fade,
Nor shall your garden ever turn to dust
As long as we may sit there in its shade
Where you will read your novels (if you must):
So long as squirrels squeak and skies are blue,
So long lives this, my vow of faith to you.

I stumbled across this amongst old email drafts -- apparently I wrote another sonnet from Valjean's POV, but never posted it? Perhaps because it wasn't betaed and I don't feel confident about writing poetry, but YOLO.

My lover's eyes are nothing like the stars,Which shine with distant cold: his gaze is keen,His hands most careful where they touch old scars,Vestiges that for ages were unseen;He knows my past: from him I do not hide, Nor do I flee his eager, earnest touch, For though I feared him, Heaven turned the tide,Creating friend from foe, caress from clutch;And so life's autumn brought another spring,Another love to ease my loneliness;And though he mourns my years of suffering,I could not wish for more than I possess:For after all my solitude and shame,He made me whole and gave me back my name.
