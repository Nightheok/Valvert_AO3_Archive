If convictionIs enough to hold up the weight of the world,Then there would be fewer children weeping. 

If strengthIs all one needs to resist, push back unyielding against the worldThen there would be far fewer convicts crying out under the lash.

If the starsAre all that guide you in the darknessThen the light of the moon will dim until it is eclipsed.

If you, InspectorHave not the power to bear this burdenTo tuck away all your cares into the pocket of your uniformThen how shall I carry the weight of your body,Soaked and weighted with the unworthy filth of the Seine?
