I stare into the river.I cannot believe you are gone.It was just yesterday that I saw you.

Back at the barricades,You learned that people can change.We saw each otherFor who we were.For the first time,You were afraid.I tried to persuade you to leave,To live,Yet you are gone.

What is destroying me is your confession.In Montreuil-sur-Mer, I saw that you took an interest in me.When you visited me,You removed your shield of indifferenceAnd were open.Then, in that alleyway,Behind the barricade,You told me that you loved me.Why did you not tell me sooner?I admit that I felt something for you.Yet, I was afraid to tell youFor the sole reason of safety.If we were different men,We could have had a relationship.We could have grown old together.

Most people do not engage inA decades-long game of cat-and-mouse.We had our differences.Time cannot healCertain things, I suppose.

Our paths have beenEntwinedFor all these years.Fate has been cruel to the both of us.At any time,I would have been glad to hold your handThrough your pain.

I wish I could have done somethingTo save you.It is difficult to accept your death.Though you are gone, You are with me in my heart.Yet, I am still alone.I wish I could haveDried the tears that you shed,Held you in my arms,And most of all,Remind you that you are loved.

Whatever you thought of yourself,I wished to tell youThat you have made me a better man.Regardless of your parentage,You were a good man.You were my guiding star.Your determination was admirable.To see you broken at the barricadesTerrified me.Perhaps that is why I kissed you.Did I foresee your death?I do not know. 

I feel bound byThe life you left behind.How can I live without you?You have been essentialTo myExistence.The pain of losing youWill not heal.I will always remember you,My love,My star,My immortal.
