Anger.
So much anger.
Hate burns in your eyes like a fire and your passion
is so hot that it wounds me.
Weak as I am.
Oh yes
I know.

Does that surprise you?
Does it surprise you to know that I run out of pure, selfish fear?
You have always called me a coward in the night.
And you have always been correct.
You are so often right about me
when no one else is.
When no one else can catch my lies
you see right through them
as if they were naught but glass.

It is almost humorous
in a cruel
ironic
way.
That you―
my constant pursuer
the source of my starts
and glances thrown over my shoulder
at dancing shadows in the night;
whose name
can cause fear
so white–hot it brings tears to my eyes
to bloom
deep in my stomach;
sending it’s thorn-garbed vines
creeping up through my chest
to wrap around my heart
and smother it―

You
are perhaps
the one person on this earth
who knows me best.
Perhaps better than I myself.

And that is why I laugh
and why it sounds so wrong
(I know it does, for I see the new emotions in your eyes
tinting the anger
with shock,
confusion,
and,
is that fear, Inspector?
Do you fear me now?)
echoing from my lips.

For how can one
who knows me so well
know so damned little
all at once?

You and I,
we spend our days
trapped
(Or did we choose this?
I know not.)
in a never-ending dance.
Circling,
lunging,
testing one another for weakness,
for cracks in our armor―
I know you have found many in mine―
but never striking.

Perhaps
like me
you know
that should one of us strike,
should we break our eternal dance,
you will draw blood
and I will run
just as I always do.

Run from the fire
burning in your eyes.
