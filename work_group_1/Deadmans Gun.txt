There is a story behind the characters but I don't know if it's better for you all to create your own. 

Just keep in mind that Javert was a Sheriff, the posters are "Post-Seine" where he still wears his Sheriff badge but instead of Sheriff, he engraved LOVER with a knife. Not wanting to forget that he still has a duty, but this time with his heart (Valjean and their daughter) and not the Law. 





I've kept Valjean with a riffle because in the Brick he was a very good hunter. And Javert, of course, his two pistols. 

 


 This is awesome but I am not too much into Red Dead Redemption stuff, I just came here for the Cowboy porn:  


 





They have to deal all day with their daughter. At night, when she sleeps, they spend the time together next to the campfire under the stars.
