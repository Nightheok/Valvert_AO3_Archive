Work text:

I'm happily making up for thirty years out of the Les Mis fandom and rather enjoying what has been going on while I was away. The nicest thing is finding that there is Jean Valjean / Javert slash fiction as it allows the characters to live on and to interact happily with each other. I can't exactly think of Colm Wilkinson or Roger Allam in the role (I was young when I met them) but a genuinely gay Valjean who came slightly after, and Javert actors I have never met can fill well for imagining them in my head. I've certainly got a hair kink with the Inspector's queue ;-)

I also have a habit of making cover art so the works I download can live happily on my ebook readers. I'm usually designing them in my head as I am reading the book the first time. There is hole in a wall near my flat which I walk past every day. When I did that today I realised I had to take a photo and use it for this story. What do you think?
