Work text:

I promised this once I'd got my dodgy shoulder back in working order. A few doses of ibuprofen and moving the computer back onto the desk so I can use the mouse properly and I'm done.







p.s. Kaleran - I've been a bit naughty here. It may just look like some nice orchestral music layered with a nice fountain but I also sneaked a grab of an orchestra into the background. The person conducting looked, from behind, rather like that certain once actor, now conductor we know (they have a similar taste in T-shirts too). And yes Kaleran, you have as much claim to him as I have, sharing is the important bit of fandom as I well know (and the truth I write about).
