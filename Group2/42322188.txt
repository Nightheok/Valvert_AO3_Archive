Summary:
Javert has never known or cared about the difference between an herb and a weed. But in Jean Valjean's garden, he's finally willing to learn.

Work text:






The first few days after they returned were quiet. Javert was still too raw for visitors; there were moments when he shouted at Valjean over nothing, and moments when he clung to Valjean like a lost child. He showed Javert the house and the garden, and explained how things like food and time and sleep worked. Javert became bored easily, with no existing hobbies and no work to do, so Valjean set him to weeding some of the more easily identifiable plants in the garden, and told him, as promised, how he learned of what happened to Javert, and been unable to forget, and how he had come to decide that he would stay with him until they could leave together.
