Work text:

A very quick and dirty ebook cover using free clipart from openclipart.org. I usually do this when I first download a fic so I can identify it on my Kobo. Only later, once I've read it / understand it better do I make something more complicated. This time I thought the simple version worked best and I'm going to keep it.
