Summary:
A small text fic with my friend! There isn't any goal to this, nor a clear ending, so do with it as you will!

Work text:

Javert:  You stole bread though, which happens to be a big NO. Bread is sacred

Valjean: It truly is But my brother's child was close to death :(( And they were starving!!

Javert: And you will starve again
Unless you know the meaning of the law


Valjean: I know the meaning of those 19 years a slave Of your law

Javert: I was actually trying to get you pardoned, but I guess that's out the window now 5 years for what you did, and the rest because you tried to run Yes, 24601?

Valjean: My name is Jean Valjean, rude >:((

Javert: I don't give a fuck. However... 
I AM JAVERT. DO NOT FORGET MY NAME.  DO NOT FORGET ME
24601

Valjean: Rude * hiss *

Javert: As I should be, with criminals
Do you want your parol ticket or should I fry it for dinner?

Valjean: I'd doubt it taste any good, but I won't mind considering that you probably eat way disgusting things than paper
And yes, I will take that paper, thank you.

Javert:
Yes, my duties have me regularly consume the souls of convicts, which are far more disgusting than paper
* Writes DO NOT FORGET MY NAME * 
Here

Valjean:
As if the souls of convicts can help you sustain a better appearance

Javert:
I look fine

Valjean:
* looks at paper *
Obsessed, are we?

Javert:
Well, I am a guard and that is all that matters
Whether I happen to be a coat or not is none of your concern

Valjean:
Ba! You're far too cold to be a coat

Javert: 
Then I am not a coat, common sense
Could a coat talk?

Valjean
No, but a guard should not talk back to a convict either, and yet here we are

Javert:
What else am I supposed to do if you refuse to clear out of my sight?
No matters there either though, I'll see you back here sooner or later

Valjean:
Ignore me, clearly
Bah! As If I'd allow that to happen to myself

Javert:
Men like you never change
Now get out of here before I arrest you for trespassing and loitering

Valjean:
How am I-- doesn't matter.
Will do, officer.

 

M-sur- M era. Non-canon. Valjean had fetched Cosette and she is now staying with sister Simplice at this time. The Confrontation but civilized.


Valjean:


Javert


 


Javert: 



I see you remembered my name


 


Valjean:



You cannot talk stop talking about it, how can I?


 


Javert:


You paid attention! How is that my fault?


 


Valjean:



You didn't need to say it in the first place, you know that right?



I'm only one in a million, Inspector.


 


Javert:



Yet, we keep meeting


 


Valjean:



Is it my fault?


 


Javert:



I would say no, but who knows if you aren't doing it intentionally to get the upper hand?



Always one eye on the law, searching for a way to escape punishment


 


Valjean:



Inspector, unlike you, I have much better things to look for besides keeping my attention to a man who would stare at me as if I've done something wrong



Paperwork is tedious, we both know you know that


 


Javert:



Do you say you haven't done anything wrong?


 


Valjean:



I have not


 


Javert:



Why did you go to jail then?



Identity fraud?? Kidnapping?



So much fraud



So, so much fraud



Do you know how many papers I had to fill just for the frauds?


 


Valjean:



I-- did not kidnap anyone!


 


Javert:



I do not believe your words


 


Valjean:



Do you have any proof I did?


 


Javert:


.. I .. well, what about the child you uprooted from the inn?



I have the words of the innkeeper



--Though I don't take their words-- for facts.


 


Valjean:



I have the papers from her mother giving her custody to me, Inspector


 


Javert:



Her mother was a convicted criminal



Her words mean nothing


 


Tatsu



BOT



Yesterday at 23:01







Javert:



See? My point has been conceded


 


Valjean:



Did you or did you not see the action that took place before Monsieur had decided to call out for you?



I was there, and you arrested the victim


 


Javert:



How can I trust the words of criminals?





Valjean:



You are the only one who thinks of me as a criminal as of right now, Inspector


 


Javert:



I had found the woman attacked the gentleman, and so I did what I had to do



Aren't you?


 


Valjean:



Did you not see the gentlemen attack her first? Putting the snowball on her bosom before she attacked in self-defense?



* avoids question *


 


Javert



No.


 


Valjean:


There, you see?


 


Javert:



So what say you, the woman was wrongfully convicted?





Valjean:



She is


 


Javert:



She might not have instigated the fight but she had harmed a respectable member of the upper-class, my duty was to see society protected from further violence


 


Valjean:



And if you were to say that she should be convicted for being mutuals with a "criminal" I, as you say, I will be true that she did not know who I was, nor what am I


 


Javert:



I really don't believe you, so save it



For the court


 


Valjean:



Had he harmed her first that resulted in herself being ill and eventually to her inevitable death?


 


Javert:



Consequences for not committing to honest work


 


Valjean:



She was working for her daughter



The foreman threw her out for working for her daughter


 


Javert:



.... And who established the rules in the first place?


 


Valjean:



They did not forward it to me, Inspector. And It is partly my fault for not asking whether there are any new changes


 


Javert:



And I am at fault for doing my duty?



You know she would not have been charged in the first place? The man did not file a case



She would have been taken to holding as a warning, it would have kept both members from instigating further fights in a while



But you had to full rank and insult me of all the townsfolk and the constables because of your misguided 'pity'





Javert:



It is not. She is a criminal and she deserves to know the consequences of hurting upstanding members of the society


 


Javert:


Her crimes have been justly punished. She needs to learn there are consequences and her place in society. It seems she was aware and thus, the gentleman simply put her in her place. As superiors do



Heathens like you don't understand the concept of obedience and law


 


Valjean:



Inspector,, 


 


Javert:



Everyone must adhere to their roles, as simple as that



You disagree because you stole the position of Mayor, fooled so many innocent townsfolk


 


Valjean:



Even if I did, Did I not help the economy? A little bit



No, no, do not say anything as of yet, Inspector


 


Javert:



But you cheated innocent people and kept the rightful owner-------


 


Valjean:



The said gentlemen did not put her in place, everyone deserves to be respected regardless of status. That may not be what rules the entire land, but it is a virtue in this town, the people's town.


 


Javert:



Wait.. why am I obeying you. You aren't my superior any longer







Valjean:


Not until the court has told me that I am not


 


Javert:



It's bullshit what it is. This is all conjecture and you are biding time to escape, aren't you??



You. I.. you confessed, 24601, I have the arrest warrant



(Javert is wondering why he lived to say this day)



Subordinates obey superiors for superiors are always right, no matter the circumstance


 


Valjean:



I would not be sitting here acting civilized if I am, would I, Inspector?


 


Javert:



That is the law



............. What


 


Valjean:



I am not escaping, I do not resist. I am acting civilized as I should be, I am not buying time


 


Javert:



Wh-why.. why not?


 


Valjean:



I will do as the law obeys, but as of now that the papers are still not being processed and I am yet your superior, I will be transparent and equal with you until my chance has run out


 


Javert:



You.. you do say you are Jean Valjean, Prisoner 24601, the parole breaker?



............. Did I come here---without a warrant



This is another one of your ploys, yes, 24601? Very clever



I am not budging


 


Valjean:



Ploys? I am not resisting Javert.







Javert:



I am afraid I do not believe you


 


Valjean:



You will believe what you believe in. I will believe what I believe in and that is that I am not resisting





Javert:



What do you believe in?



That you can escape again? With all these acts? I won't be fooled twice


 


Valjean:



Would you like some Coffee, Javert?
