Turns out that when I edited and posted this and the next chapter the first time it was with a pair of dodgy headphones. I adjusted the audio so that it sounded centered to me - which means it was way off to one ear for the rest of the world. Sorry about that, it should be fixed now!

Now with 99.8% more dialogue!

Chapter Summary:


Javert is surprised to find himself awakeâ€”and, by extension, alive. He is not exactly pleased. An argument ensues.

What was a chapter with sound way off in one ear should now be gloriously centered! Rejoice!

I would like to formally apologize to the French for what I am doing to their language. It's only going to get worse from here.

So me and this chapter... did not get along. Please, take it away from me, let me move on to the next one.

You know what they say about perfect being the enemy of good? Yeah, that. But! Here is comes, finally an opportunity for me to flub a line by going to high pitched in stead of going too low.

Javert attempts to get himself out of an awkward situation and only partially succeeds.

This one goes out to the one who overheard me recording the argument in this chapter and got genuinely concerned for my well-being. Take it as an endorsement of my acting I guess?

Hubris, I tell you; sheer hubris. This chapter was basically finished, I thought three months ago, better spend my time finishing chapter seven and looking ahead to chapters nine and ten. Turns out, what I thought only needed a cursory glace was all but useless, and by then I had far fewer opportunities to record. Suppose I got complacent. Well! At long last, it's here!
