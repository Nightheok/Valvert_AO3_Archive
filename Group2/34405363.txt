Summary:
It was a miracle to see him like this, deep in slumber without a worry on his brows. They’ve been at each other’s throat for so long now, chasing, running, dancing around each other. But the Barricade, the Seine, Cosette, all of them had lead up to this moment.

Work text:

It was a miracle to see him like this, deep in slumber without a worry on his brows. They’ve been at each other’s throat for so long now, chasing, running, dancing around each other. But the Barricade, the Seine, Cosette, all of them had lead up to this moment.

It lead to this moment where Javert could gaze at his Jean with adoration. The man that had turned his life upside down, was now asleep, snoring gently in his arms. 

His hair, snow-white after the Arras gleamed in the sunlight. He stroked them as gentle as he could, not wanting to wake the slumbering man just yet.

Jean deserved his sleep, and many, many more with his happiness being one of them. Even after everything he had done for Javert, the man always seemed to never valued his own life.

Always selfless and caring, carrying a burden he did not have to bear alone.

The night he had declared his love for the man sleeping in front of him, Jean wept into his arms, thanking and apologizing to him of things that neither needed to be thanked or forgiven.

He had stroked his back, then and assured him that he’d never leave his side.

Tentatively, he placed a kiss on the man’s forehead, a soft and indulgent smile gracing his own lips as the memory resurfaced.

As he heard a groan that signified wakefulness from the man under him, Javert smiled once more, this time brighter and wider, and said. “I love you, Jean.”

He then heard a small chuckle and saw the man under him, still half-asleep, smiling at him with nothing but love.
