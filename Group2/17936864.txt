There was nothing else to do, but return his life to the mother Seine.

Work text:

Bands upon bands of frigid watersFurrowing, crashing, slipping without patternThe broken man standsAt the edge of the Seine.Blessed was She, mother of FranceThough surely her draught of lifeDraws in life and enfolds, roaring and quiet.

The broken man, his world flippedHis cross flipped, worthy was he not,To assert the light and dark?Yet uncertain interludes in betweenMan of light yet no more, never onceAnd there was nothing else to doBut return his life to the Mother Seine.

Stepping behind him, an angel weary, weltedWary of the rapids, he knows too wellOf its crippling cold, merciless gripLife in tandem with death, faith with despairHe jumps in after the man, two stepsOff of the Mother Seine, Icy Hell seizing his muscle.

In the murk of the gray Purgatory SeineTrapped between life and deathHe looks frantically for the lost bodyBroken man careening downstreamReaches toward him swiftlyThough he is getting further awayHead shocked, flailing, helpless

Regret, human in its errors, in its sinThe broken man weeps with fear and joyReady to pay his penance, finalPossession he had to give, HellboundNo, it was not his, it was the angel’sAnd he would have no sooner let go of himAs he hadn’t with his Heaven.
