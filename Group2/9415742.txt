Work text:

Oblivion should have claimed meThat NightBut you appearedThe shining saint I never neededNever knew I neededYou could have walked awayBut you didnâ€™tYou took meInto your homeInto your bedInto your heart

I should have diedThat NightBut you appeared

The river still callsBut I no longer hear Oblivion still waitsBut I no longer wantOnce I thought you were the manWho had torn me apartNow I know you are the manWho has pieced me back togetherWith your love
