Sketch - Emm: For my sketch, I opted to keep the figures and the details simple, to allow the line artist some fun and flexibility in defining them.I was inspired by the outfit prompts, particularly the body chain, which was bedecked with ornaments that reminded me of shark teeth. I decided to follow a nautical theme this time around, and the image of a merman Valjean draped in all that gold chain was too tempting to resist.I also felt compelled to make Javert a creature as well, and what would a monster art swap be without some tentacles? 😉The story here is open to interpretation—was there a marriage of convenience between two rivals? A magical pact sealed and consummated in lust? Two denizens of the sea, joined at last in a loving embrace? I can’t decide, but I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Lineart - Fish: I loved the sketch and the idea. I'm still terrified of drawing tentacles and I still don't know how I did it. It's there a story behind it? Because the torsion of Javert's body, the sensuality in which he is holding Valjean... I would love to read about it. I hope I got those tentacles right 😂

Colours - Thoma: The wonderful choices of monsters and garments in this picture inspired me to imagine what story might lie behind it.Perhaps Javert is a shipwrecking creature like a kraken; but one who has betrayed his fellow monsters to ally himself with naval law and order, destroying only the ships of enemies and pirates. Valjean’s spiny anatomy made me think perhaps he is half lionfish: dangerous, with venomous spines—but evoking, in the name, the noble symbolism of lions.Perhaps Valjean has smuggled Javert out of a group of sea-monsters determined to end their oppression by humanity. And now perhaps Valjean has been captured by a seafaring Thénardier and kept in chains that are part imprisonment, part costume: of course Thénardier will show off his catch on the way to collect the bounty. Perhaps Javert has saved Valjean in turn by destroying Thénardier’s ship. And perhaps Javert has helped himself to the wreckage—a bit of ancestral prize-hoarding instinct showing through?—and donned the late captain’s dressing gown: because Javert is never quite warm enough.

Outfit Prompt: courtesy of TwelveLeagues

Sketch - Fish: I got an excited prompt following some clothes kink and chains. The monster prompt was the cherry on top so I went back to my Centaur!Valjean been dominated by a well dressed Javert. This is totally Esteliel's fault for her pony fics, damn it.

Lineart - Thoma: As centaurs are a favorite of mine, this image enabled a great deal of self-indulgence.The sketch suggested a bit in Valjean’s mouth, which I took as an excuse to give him a bridle, and then it turned into a double bridle with a curb chain... Where might they be? Most importantly, somewhere with straw for Valjean to kick up when he squirms. Or lashes his tail. Tail therefore becomes necessary. And so on. It was a gift to receive this sketch, this blank check to dress Javert to the nines and give Valjean’s muscles and his fluffiness center stage.

Colours - Emm: The moment I saw this lineart, I knew I wanted an autumn palette and the warm glow of golden hour sun. I love all the attention to detail in the centaur anatomy, so I chose a dappled grey coloring that would allow for some interesting variations in tone while keeping within a range of hair colors that felt appropriate for Valjean. I also loved all the leather details—Javert in riding boots is my weakness. 😍

Outfit Prompt: courtesy of IberianDoctor

Sketch - Thoma: The story of this sketch began as a plot to get Valjean into the stunning evening wear that I was given as a prompt. This monstrous Javert is based on a statuette of Pazuzu, leader of the Mesopotamian demons whose task it is to drag humans back to the underworld—much as it is canonically Javert’s task to drag escaped convicts back to the hell of the bagne. In the universe of this sketch, Valjean’s early crimes involve smuggling cultural artifacts, including a statue of the monstrous Javert: this statue is, magically, the slumbering demon himself. Javert awakens and hounds Valjean thereafter, always at the bidding of whatever authority possesses him. After his redemption, Valjean works toward restoring each of the artifacts he absconded with. He has just brought back the one embodying Javert—at great risk of ending up in hell—causing Javert’s derailment. Javert resolved to seize Valjean anyway, at a gala to celebrate the restoration of the building from which Valjean stole Javert. Hence Valjean’s evening dress and the fact that Javert has decided to pounce from above. But Javert’s new emotions have gotten the better of him, and the encounter is not going as planned.

Lineart - Emm: Despite my love of monsters and myths, I’d never heard of a Galla before, so it was fun to learn something new! Their description reminds me of the Greek Furies, which I think is just so appropriate an image for Javert. I had a lot of fun doing the line art for this one, especially figuring out the wings. I have a bird of my own, and wing anatomy just fascinates me! I’m even charmed by the penis snake, which isn’t a sentence I ever thought I’d say. XD

Colours - Fish: what can I say? Having to touch with my filthy hands another of Thomas artworks 😂 I can't work from sketch to color so bless Emm for the line art. They made such a good job with the feathers and their expression. I want too sure about what color to paint Javert, everytime I googled the name of the creature it appeared a villain from the Power Rangers 😂😂 I hope I got it right. I chose black colors as a Javert color base (with black hair and coat) and Valjean goes with his yellow coat.Once I finished I noticed I made it daylight instead of night. I wanted to play with the light on Javerts wings and for some reason, my thoughts about mesopotamia are full of bright sunlight.
