 Enjolras   re-named the conversation “Les Amis de l’ABC” 

 

Enjolras: Alright, hello everyone. I have created this chat to make sure everyone is informed and up to date on all of our information regarding Les Amis de l’ABC. 

 

 Courfeyrac    has logged on! 

 

 Courfeyrac   has re-named themself   Courfey-racks-on-racks 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: enj

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: my sweet bb darling enjy 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: y do u need to sound so formal all the time

 

Enjolras: I need to maintain a professional appearance at all times, Courfeyrac. This includes through text message conversations, even with friends. 

 

 Bahorel    has logged on! 

 

 Bahorel    has re-named themself   Bruh 

 

Bruh: oh cmon there’s no need to be like that dude 

 

 Combeferre    has logged on! 

 

Combeferre: E, I agree that it’s important to maintain a professional front, however, you’re amongst friends; there is really no need for the formal language

 

Bruh: ferre u literally talk the same way 

 

Combeferre: Hombre, at least I use contractions 

 

Bruh: that’s fair

 

Bruh: carry on w ur business dad

 

 Jehan    has logged on! 

 

Jehan: courf why are you criticising enjolras for talking like that but not saying shit abt ferre 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: cuz when ferre does it it's hot af

 

Combeferre: <3

 

Bruh: gross

 

 Feuilly    has logged on! 

 

 Feuilly    has re-named themself   Foo Fighter 

 

Enjolras: Feuilly, what is a “Foo Fighter”?

 

Bruh: omfg

 

Foo Fighter: Foo Fighters is an American band

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: enjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: u don’t kno foo fighters ?????

 

Enjolras: I have never found much interest in American pop culture. 

 

Enjolras: And besides, I hardly listen to mainstream music anyway. 

 

 Grantaire    has logged on! 

 

 Grantaire    has re-named themself   R 

 

R: apollo literally only listens to french music

 

R: like 

 

R: ive genuinely seen him loop “La Marseillaise” for like 3 hours straight 

 

R: he either listens to that or to Yves Montand or Édith Piaf

 

Bruh: whomst tf is Yves Montand 

 

Combeferre: He’s an old French singer; he was rather popular from the 40s to his death in the 90s. Édith Piaf was actually the one to discover him originally

 

Combeferre: It’s a little funny actually, since Yves Montand wasn’t even born in France

 

Combeferre: But E practically worships him, and always has

 

Enjolras: He was extremely talented. 

 

 Cosette    has logged on! 

 

 Cosette    has re-named themself   Cassette 

 

Cassette: Enjolras listens to Lorde

 

 Cassette    has logged off! 

 

Bruh: OMFG OFC U DO

 

Enjolras: Lies and slander. 

 

R: that's a bit hypocritical ain’t it apollo ?

 

R: you’re out here criticising the aristocracy but you partake in listening to Lorde, whose name is derived from the aristocracy 

 

Bruh: R shut tf up 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: enjy-poo how could u hide this from me??????

 

Combeferre: I agree; how did we not know this beforehand? We’ve known you for almost two decades, and we only figure this out now?

 

Foo Fighter: Honestly I’m not super surprised tbh, I knew there had to be something up

 

Jehan: enj what’s your favourite song

 

Enjolras: Alright, first off, I am aware of the potential “hypocrisy” of the situation, but Lorde actually critiques many social events, and she does it in a very lovely way. I enjoy her voice. Second off, I never really hid this from anyone, you all just never pay attention to what I listen to. 

 

Bruh: prolly cuz ur always listening to the fucking national anthem

 

Enjolras: It is rude to interrupt people.

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: oooooo get em enjy 

 

Enjolras: Thirdly, to answer Johan’s question; my favourite song is “Liability”. 

 

Jehan: oh hmm, i was expecting something from “pure heroine” tbh, but “melodrama” is good too

 

 Joly    has logged on! 

 

 Joly    has re-named themself   Jelly Belly 

 

Jelly Belly: Omgggggg Enjolras listens to Lorde? I love her sm

Andy: enj shut the hell up i KNOW you know parks and rec 

 

Currently Doing That: How do you change your name back?

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: no 1 tell him

 

Currently Doing That: Courfeyrac, this is not funny. Someone tell me how to change it.

 

Bruh: hang on dude i got u

 

Bruh had re-named Currently Doing That to Enjol-sassy-ass

 

Enjol-sassy-ass: What the hell, Bahorel? I trusted you. 

 

Bruh: cmon chief, loosen up 

 

Enjol-sassy-ass: Combeferre, can you do something?

 

Combeferre: If I must 

 

 Combeferre    has re-named   Enjol-sassy-ass    to   Lover of Liberté, Lorde and Lesbians 

 

Lover of Liberté, Lorde and Lesbians: Et tu, Brutus?

 

Foo Fighter: Oh my god you’re dramatic, no wonder your favourite Lorde song is from “Melodrama”

 

 Andy    has re-named themself   R 

 

 R   has re-named   Lover of Liberté, Lorde and Lesbians    to   E

Épi-Pen: ok but u go to the hippie stores 

 

Épi-Pen: those dont even know what high fructose corn syrup is

 

E: They are not “hippie stores”. They are simply locally sourced markets. 

 

Épi-Pen: i refuse to believe that youve lived in the gayest part of france for forever but have never had a poptart

 

E: Why are we all so hung up on this?

R: okay so basically

 

R: enj was studying for his english class 

 

R: and you guys know how he gets when he has to study for english

 

Épi-Pen: he doesn't discriminate against different races or sexualities but that man definitely oppresses people who speak english

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: omg his english is terrible but im too scared to correct it

 

Bruh: did someone mess w him when he was studying bc if so 

 

Bruh: yikes

 

R: so the whole story-

enj was studying for english, and it was like mid afternoon. so i decided to be a good boyfriend and bring him some coffee so that he didnt pass out. and i get there and i give him his coffee, and we just sorta study together

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: ***jet fuel

 

Épi-Pen: enjs coffee tastes are horrific

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: i have no idea how he isnt dead yet

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: he gets like 4 shots of espresso 

 

R: he gets 8

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: WHAT

 

Épi-Pen: WHAT

 

Bruh: WHAT

 

R: anyway

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: no you cant just “anyway” your way out of saying enjolras drinks coffee with EIGHT ESPRESSO SHOTS

 

R: do you want me to finish the story

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: …...yes

 

R: okay so, we were studying, and suddenly this super drunk guy walks in. its like 2 pm and this guy is HAMMERED

 

Épi-Pen: oh god

 

R: so i'm sitting across the table from enj and he collapses into a chair next to me. he starts flirting with me in english but im trying to turn him down as soon as he starts speaking, cause my boyfriend was literally sitting 2 feet in front of me

 

R: but this guy just wont stop. and eventually he tries to get a little handsy

 

R: enj has no clue what this guys saying cause he has the thickest fucking texas accent ive EVER heard, but he can see that im uncomfortable 

 

R: so he calmly stands up and walks over to the guy and the guy gets up and is like, raring for a fight

 

R: the guy goes into a fighting stance, but enj, still calm as hell, hits him in the face with a left hook and then judo flips the guy over the table 

 

R: the only thing he says after breaking a guys nose and flipping him onto a table ?

 

R: which he broke as well btw

 

R: “i think i broke my left hand, do you think combeferre would be willing to help me with writing for a little while”

 

Bruh: holy shit

 

Épi-Pen: i take back everything ive ever said about him

 

Épi-Pen: i take it back, he is NOT A TWINK

: ❤️


 


E
: Why is it only pathetic when I do it. 


 


Cassette
: Because you literally walked past the university like 8 times a week, but never said a WORD to Grantaire 


 


E
: In my defense, English is very hard for some of us. 


 


Jehan
: we know


 


Épi-Pen
: oh GOD do we know


 


Cassette
: You can speak Occitan and Basque, but not English 


 


Cassette
: You’re so intelligent, yet so, so stupid


 


E
: Now who’s being rude?


 


Épi-Pen
: also enj, yeah r n i moved to france from america, but we can still speak french 


 


Épi-Pen
: you really didn’t have an excuse cause we speak english with each other, but we also both speak french


 


E
: Well there really isn’t a reason to be hung up on this 4 years later, considering we’ve been together long enough for me to gain and lose key privileges, get banned from the university library, bring him to meet my dads, and for him to teach me how to play guitar, kind of. 


 


E
: I’m not very good. 


 


Jehan
: couple goals


 


Cassette
: I’m assuming that those aren’t in order because dad and papa still don’t know how you broke your hand


 


E
: Do YOU?


 


Épi-Pen
: yes we do 


 


Épi-Pen
: and i would like to apologise for every insult i’ve ever thrown at you


 


E
: Have any of you hit on my boyfriend?


 


Épi-Pen
: no


 


Jehan
: no


 


Cassette
: No


 


E
: You’re all safe then. 


 


Épi-Pen
: i was actually kinda scared for a sec


 


Jehan
: enj is a merciful god


 


Jehan
: but me n ép are gonna have cake now


 


Jehan
: if you two want any we’re at r’s place


 


E
: I need to grab something from there anyway, so I’m on my way over. 


 


Épi-Pen
: what’re you getting


 


E
: I left a sweatshirt there, but now that I think about it, it was red, and most of his are green. 


 


Cassette
: Lol good luck


 


Cassette
:I’m coming over too, but I’m not helping you with that


 


Épi-Pen
: wait does this mean what i think it does


 


Épi-Pen
: enj are you colourblind


 


Jehan
: OMG THAT'S WHY YOU ACTED LIKE THAT WHEN I TOOK YOU TO THE LOUVRE


 


E
: Why does everyone feel the need to attack me whenever I’m active here. 


 


Cassette
: You make it really easy


 


Épi-Pen
: wow cosette is ruthless today


 


Épi-Pen
: also how did he act jehan


 


Jehan
: okay first off he refused to leave “Liberty leading the people” for like, a full hour


 


Jehan
: but when he finally let us move on, he pointed at a painting and said “hmm the colours are very colourful”

here we see the return of enjolras the very poor english speaker 

i love the idea that he learns obscure languages to help keep them from dying out, but basically refuses to get better at english. like grantaire speaks english so why does he need to learn it right ?

i have so much fun with colourblind enjolras, the idea is honestly just hilarious dont even @ me

the comments ive gotten have made me so happy i honestly love you all so much, even though youre all strangers on the internet id hug you if i knew who you were <3

also, im only now realising that all of the chapter titles are about enj but who caresssss

okay so i just wanted to say that everything grantaire mentions are my own experiences 

i had braces from april 2014 to still now, until this friday 

i had dental bonding done today and it does NOT feel good :(

but yeah, hi im el and i broke the 4th wall for fun

you guys that keep commenting on all of my chapters ????? i love you <3

Jehan
: and no enjolras, i see you typing, no victor hugo characters, that’s cheating 


 


Enjolras
: Okay, fine. 


 


Enjolras
: I would be Atticus Finch. I care deeply about equality on every level, and I am prepared to fight for what I believe in. 


 


Jehan
: ok but you’re prepared to fight in general 


 


Enjolras
: That point is irrelevant. 


 


Jehan
: but yeah i agree, you’re definitely atticus


 


Jehan
: i’d say i’m probably ophelia from hamlet


 


Jehan
: i have a tragic love story, because YOU SIR have mocked me and stopped me from joining éponine and cosette and making us a trio


 


Jehan
: but other than that


 


Jehan
: i like flowers, and her death was very poetic so yeah i’m ophelia


 


Enjolras
: Allow me to make the assumptions for others in the chat?


 


Jehan
: enj you don’t need to ask permission it’s literally your chat


 


Enjolras
: Combeferre is Tintin and I don’t really have an explanation but it feels right. 


 


Jehan
: that’s fair


 


Enjolras
: Courfeyrac is Mercutio, because he is loud, annoying and gay. He also likes puns, and I feel that he would make one on his deathbed. 


 


Enjolras
: Éponine is Lizzie Bennet. She doesn’t let men fuck her over and willingly chooses her love interest, instead of just having them handed to her. Hence the fact that she chose Cosette over someone such as Montparnasse. 


 


Enjolras
: Marius is Romeo and I think that’s self explanatory. 


 


Enjolras
: Grantaire is Dr. Hastie Lanyon. He’s a sceptic and when his world is changed beyond belief, he just leaves and dies.

Combeferre

Épi-Pen

Jelly Belly
: Guys I’m just really concerned for Grantaire!!!!!!!


 


R
: joly im fine


 


Enjolras
: His mouth is fine, you can hardly even tell that the inside of his top lip was split in half once. 


 


Combeferre
: How do you know where his frenectomy was done?


 


Enjolras
: He mentioned it a little while ago and I researched it. 


 


R

Jehan

Jehan
: she’s a russian ballet dancer who’s with the royal ballet in london as a principal ballerina 


 


Enjolras
: Cosette made me watch her rendition of “La Esmeralda”. She was quite good, but I have no dance knowledge to speak of. 


 


Épi-Pen
: wait can we go back to the fact that Combeferre answered


 


Épi-Pen
: in less than like 10 seconds after the question was asked

Jehan

Enjolras
: I got a french translation. 


 


R

R
: you also listened to the musical 


 


Enjolras

featuring cameos from my actual oral hygienists

liane went sicko mode on my gums last week, and peg is usually very nice but i didn’t HAVE HER

and yes, i did bust open the stitches in my mouth a DAY after my frenectomy 

i hit myself in the mouth with the corner of a Percy Jackson book, it split open, and i pulled out the stitches like “oh huh what’s this”

also im sorry, this chapter definitely has the most ooc Enjolras so far, but i promise im trying to get them at least somewhat in line !!

once again, if you comment, please marry me

yay another chapter !!

the ideas just keep coming honestly, i dont think i can ever stop

also, if you havent noticed, i base grantaires adventures off of my own

the events of this chapter have never happened to me, but the upcoming chapters will probably involve a can of tuna, baby sunglasses, 4 broken saxophones, or falling on the field in front of judges at a marching band competition 

thanks for all the comments and kudos, each one makes me smile for at least an hour honestly

Cosette it is very rude to have your phone out at the dinner table. 

 


Julien and Papa aren’t even here!


 

Yes, and I blame Charles for that. Is he in this “group chat” of yours?

 


Not anymore apparently, he left it. 


 

Well oka- Cosette why is it recording?

 


What?


 

Cosette it’s recording a thing— how do i stop it?

 


Dad what are you talking about?


 

COSETTE!! THE THING IS GOING, WHAT DO I DO?

 


Just give me the phone. 


 

No. I will not. »

 

Cassette: Hello all, this is Officer Javert with the Paris police force. Has anyone heard from Charles Grantaire? I would like to have a chat with him.  

 

Bruh: okay so that's where enjolras gets his scary from

 

Cassette: Yes, my son has adapted my stricter qualities. 

 

Combeferre: Good evening Javert, is there any particular reason you’re looking for Grantaire?

 

Cassette: Oh, Jean-Michel! I’m glad to see you here, you have always been my favourite of Julien’s friends.

 

Cassette: Not to be rude to any of you. 

 

Cassette: Though I do like the small flowery one as well. 

 

Jehan: thank you sir!

 

Cassette: Jean-Michel, I am looking for Charles as I am assuming he has abducted my son and husband. 

 

Chetta: Hello sir! I’m Musichetta, and I believe that Grantaire is outside his flat right now, so I’m assuming that M. Valjean and Enjolras are with him

Courfey-racks-on-racks: hello sir

 

Cassette: Mathieu, what does your name mean?

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: it’s a part of a song, sir

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: it’s by an American artist

 

Cassette: Who is the artist?

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: oh god

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: his name is Lil Pump

 

Cassette: ‘Lil Pump?’

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: yessir

 

Enjolras: Okay, Javert. Grantaire is at his flat, and I brought Valjean here because he was locked out without a key, and since I’m not as good at picking locks as he is, I needed to take him. 

 

Enjolras: I apologise for leaving dinner, but my boyfriend needed my help. 

 

 Enjolras    has added   Grantaire    to the conversation  

 

Grantaire: hello sir

 

Cassette: Hello Charles. 

 

Cassette: I will let this slip this time, but in the future, I do NOT wish to be interrupted when I am having dinner with my children. 

 

Cassette: Am I understood?

 

Grantaire: yes sir, loud and clear 

 

Cassette: Good. 

 

Cassette: Good night to all of you. Jean-Michel and Mathieu, I hope to see you around soon. Mathieu, perhaps you could show me who this ‘Lil Pump’ is. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: i would love nothing more

 

Cassette: I will speak to you all later. 

 

Cassette: Or perhaps (and hopefully) never. 

 

Cassette: Oh my god I’m so sorry 

 

Jelly Belly: I’ve never been more afraid and he wasn’t even mad at me 

 

Enjolras: And you all say that I have a stick up my ass. 

 

Enjolras: That’s why Javert is so tall. 

 

Grantaire: don’t speak of your father like that julien

 

Grantaire: he’s kind but he’s a little 

 

Grantaire: difficult 

 

Bruh: did their other dad just take R’s phone ??

 

Grantaire: i apologise, but grantaire looked as though he would drop it 

 

Grantaire: he seemed rather scared 

 

Grantaire: cosette, tell javert that enjolras will not be coming back tonight

 

Cassette: Will do papa

 

Grantaire: lovely

 

Grantaire: i’ll be heading back over to you now

Courfey-racks-on-racks: ur my favourite

Cassette: Also Bahorel

 

Cassette: Papas an ex con, so he can pick locks

 

Cassette: So can Enjolras, but he doesn’t show that talent off too much

 

Bruh: oh great another reason to be afraid of him

 

Combeferre: He’s relatively harmless

 

Enjolras: I am perfectly harmless. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: sure

 

Bruh: courf are u gonna play lil pump for javert

 

Bruh: can i be there when u do

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: oh FUCK yea

Courfey-racks-on-racks: ill play gucci gang first

 

Enjolras: Lil Pump??

 

Bruh: nope

 

Bruh: don’t answer him

 

Jehan: answer him in english

 

Jehan: make him LEARN

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: “Gazzy Garcia (born August 17, 2000), known professionally as Lil Pump, is an American rapper and songwriter. He is known for his hyperactive public persona, where he is often portrayed taking drugs”

R: huh

 

R: weird

 

Combeferre: Wait, Courf-

 

Combeferre: How the hell did you get Enjolras drunk?

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: everything comes back to his poor ability to speak english

 

R: ffs

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: shut the up fuck

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: anyway, i decided to play a game with him, where i would say something in english and if he could translate it to french, i’d take a shot, but if he couldn’t, he’d take a shot

 Combeferre   has created a private conversation with   Courfeyrac  

 

Combeferre: How much has he had

 

Courfeyrac: i don’t know !!!

 

Courfeyrac: oh my god he’s crying what do i DO






 Courfey-racks-on-racks    has sent a video to “Enjolras lets R bitch” 

 

« [Enjolras is sobbing on Courfeyrac’s couch, burying his face into the cushions]

 


I just- I just love her so much!


 


Who do you love Enj?


 


Patria! I wish- I wish that she would love- love me back…


 


Enj, I’m sure she does. 


 

[Enjolras suddenly swings his body up and grins]

 


Courf! Guess what!


 


 What is it bud? 


 

[Enjolras begins to speak in English, with a mix of a French accent a Southern United States accent, but perfectly coherent and not at all slurred]

 


Thomas Jefferson once said that all men are created equal, a phrase that the Yankees and the distaff side of the Executive branch in Washington are fond of hurling at us.


 


 What? 


 


There is a tendency in this year of grace, 1935, for certain people to use this phrase out of context, to satisfy all conditions. The most ridiculous example I can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the industrious—because all men are created equal, educators will gravely tell you, the children left behind suffer terrible feelings of inferiority.


 


 Did you memorise Atticus’ closing speech? 


 


We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe—some people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because they’re born with it, some men make more money-


 


 That’s enough of that.

 Enjolras    has sent a voice message to “Enjolras lets R bitch” 

 


Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets of cities inundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, nations sisters, men just, old men blessing children, the past loving the present, thinkers entirely at liberty, believers on terms of full equality, for religion heaven, God the direct priest, human conscience become an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and the school, for sole penalty and recompense fame, work for all, right for all, peace over all, no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers!


 

Enjolras what the fuck. 

 


 Dude what are you even talking about? 


 


We are going to save the world! Can’t you see, Courf? Down with the monarchy!


 

Yeah alright, Enjolras I think it’s time we head home okay?

 Enjolras   has sent a voice message to “Enjolras lets R bitch” 

 

« Okay Enjolras, can you at least try to walk for me? I can’t carry you, you’re too tall. 

 


No!


 

Enjolras you are 6 feet 5 inches tall and I am approximately 0 foot 2. Stand your scrawny ass up. 

 


Nooooooo!


 

You’re a child. 

 


‘m not. 


 

God why do I have to live on the 5th floor.

Enjolras: now we have to get the child into the elevator

 

 Enjolras    has logged off! 

 

Foo Fighter: Okay wait a minute

 

Foo Fighter: Can we go back to the fact that Enjolras fakes a Parisian accent 

 

Eagle One: yeah cosette what's that all about

 

Cassette: So when we say that we’re from the South, we ARE but Enjolras and I were actually born in Corsica

 

Cassette: We were adopted by papa and dad when we were 4 and we moved to Paris but we both say that we’re from Grenoble instead of Corsica because Enjolras thinks that saying we’re Corsican would be like saying we’re Italian instead of French

 

Combeferre: But Courf and I met you when you were 5 so how did we never hear any sort of accent out of either of you

 

Cassette: Well I didn’t really talk to either of you that much and Enjolras immediately hid it

 

Cassette: He still talks with his original accent at home but I think that’s just to piss off dad

 

Épi-Pen: enjolras originally made this chat for les amis business but now it’s just used to expose him lmao

 

 Bruh   has re-named the conversation “Exposing Enjolras”

bonus points to you if you can name where all the quotes come from

im super used to either parisian accents or accents from lyon so corsican accents are ridiculously bizarre to me

theyre weird but still understandable, but courfeyrac has never heard one before so hes having trouble deciphering it

also “le titi parisien” is an old parisian accent that you’ll typically hear in old french films from the 30s/40s, its like the american trans-atlantic accent

my two favourite things are getting meta as hell and drunk!jolras so i did both this chapter

also, for those of you who are both here and on my super angsty fic, i am in the process of writing a sequel from c squared’s perspective, so look out for that !!

thanks for all the love, i really cant even express how much it means to me <3

hi im so sorry that this took so long to get out

ive had a rough couple of days since my brain decided that suddenly it wanted my depression to act up so i haven’t felt great 

but i really didn’t want to keep you guys waiting for too long, so here’s a chapter !

sorry it’s kinda short and bad, i usually write them in one sitting but no matter how hard i tried i couldn’t do that for this 

but anyway, we hit 10.000 words ! yay ! 

thank you for the continued support <3

Enjolras: But right now I am directing my anger towards Grantaire. 

 

Enjolras: I woke up around 10 minutes ago, and I was beyond hungover, thanks to a certain someone.

Enjolras: Do I look like I’m laughing. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: no sir

 

Enjolras: Anyway. 

 

Enjolras: I woke up very hungover, and I needed painkillers, so I left Grantaire’s room to go get them. 

 

Enjolras: He was sweeping because he apparently doesn’t own a hoover. 

 

Enjolras: I didn’t even sneak up on him or anything, I just walked out of the bedroom, and suddenly he jumps at the noise and whips around to hit me in the face with the broom.

Courfey-racks-on-racks: y’know 

 

Cassette: Shut up Courfeyrac 

 

Combeferre: So I have a genuine question about Mamma Mia

 

Combeferre: Does it take place in a world where ABBA doesn’t exist, and everyone makes up the songs like it’s a movie musical 

 

Combeferre: Or have they all just memorised every ABBA song and created choreography to match 

 

Épi-Pen: i don’t like this question 

 

Bruh: i also don’t like the question 

 

Enjolras: I’ve never seen Mamma Mia

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: WHAT

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: COSETTE IS YOUR SISTER AND YOUVE NEVER SEEN MAMMA MIA

 

Enjolras: To be fair it’s in English so I don’t have any idea what’s happening. 

 

Cassette: You don’t have to speak the language to appreciate Amanda Seyfried 

 

Épi-Pen: amen

 

Enjolras: Fine. I’ll watch it sometime. 

 

Combeferre: Yeah even I have seen it 

 

Enjolras: That's because Courf has definitely made you watch it. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: yeah i did 

 

Enjolras: Is Waterloo in it?

 

Épi-Pen: ofc you’d ask that 

 

Combeferre: I don’t remember, but I remember it being in Mamma Mia! Here we go again 

 

Enjolras: Well I’ll watch that then 

 

Enjolras: Bahorel did you put Waterloo in that playlist?

 

Bruh: u bet ur sweet fucking ass i did 

 

Bruh: first song baybey 

 

Enjolras: I’m going to clean Grantaire’s flat to this playlist.

if you understand the reference to amanda seyfried, cosette, and mamma mia, i love you

im sorry if this chapter wasn’t as funny as the rest :(

also the disco playlist that bahorel sent is what ive been trying to use to cheer myself up, and im realising now that i didn’t put NEARLY enough Claude françois on there 

also, ik the majority (if not all of you) of my readers speak english, but does anyone have any recs for fics in french ? i can’t really find any :(((

but thank you all for the comments (there’s like 35 from you !! that’s so many) you guys are so sweet

hey !!! 

thanks to everyone for the loving comments, i definitely feel better than i have the past couple of days; i had my weekly call with my therapist today so she was amazing as always, and you guys’ comments were so sweet !!

ive never seen mean girls, or listened to the musical, but A_Butter_Churner asked for it and i would literally die for them so i had to add it

also shhh but as always Grantaire’s really specific stories are actually my own

(other than breaking someones nose but i HAVE jumped out of a window)

enjoy !!!!!

Jelly Belly: 18th birthday tuna?????

 

R: theres too much to explain right now

 

R: im going to clear my name right now for the saxophone situation

 

R: i only broke one

 

R: the first saxophone had the octave key bashed in by a dumbass with a trombone

 

R: the second and third were already broken because public high school instruments are garbage

 

R: and the fourth one was indeed my fault because i fell on it

 

Jelly Belly: You fell on it ??????????

 

R: i blame the drill writer for Carmen

 

R: expecting a child to book it backwards across the field in 5 seconds is asking a lot im just saying

 

Épi-Pen: lmao you completely snapped the neck off

 

R: that i did

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: thats cool n all but

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: birthday tuna ??

Jelly Belly: Courf I’m worried !!!!!!!

Courfey-racks-on-racks: i think its under the bathroom vanity

Épi-Pen: i’m actually kinda offended

 

Enjolras: Listen- I’m not completely Clueless when it comes to movies and musicals. 

 

R: did you just

 

Enjolras: It’s a shame I’m going to PSL and not SciencesPo. 

 

Enjolras: I’m already blond, now I just need a law degree. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: DID U JUST

 

Enjolras: I’ve never heard of Mean Girls but you can’t say “of course” because I’m more knowledgeable than I seem. 

 

R: youre a walking contraction is what you are

 

Enjolras: Rude.

 Courfey-racks-on-racks    has sent a video to “mean girls fanclub” 

 

« [Courfeyrac has balanced the camera against the wall and has dragged Marius into the shot]


 NOW YOU KNOW, CADY, REGINA GEORGE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND WE ARE  YOUR  FRIENDS



AND WE’RE GOING TO MAKE HER PAY



MARIUS YOUR TURN


 

Uhh you know what friends do?

They've got your back and they're fun to be around!

 


YEAH YOU GOT IT MARIUS


 

Whuh-oh, whuh-oh, whuh-oh!

When someone hurts you then they attack

And grind your foe into the ground

 

[Courfeyrac is now dancing whilst Marius sings the entire song]

 

Whuh-oh, whuh-oh, whuh-oh!

 


YEAH MAN


 

Imagine a party with dresses and cake

And singing and dancing and cake

And there's a magic act that saws Regina in half

And this time it will take!

 


UH HUH YEAH


 

Now that's a party!

 


FUCK YEA


 

A revenge party

A party that ends

With somebody's head on a spike!

 


OOOH DAMN


 

Whuh-oh, whuh-oh, whuh-oh!

 


YESSSSS


 

[Courfeyrac and Marius finish the song] »

 

Enjolras: This feels like an intimate moment that I shouldn’t have interrupted. 

 

R: im coming over

 

Enjolras: Um. 

 

Enjolras: Okay?

 

Enjolras: Any reason?

 

R: we’re gonna sing there right there 

 

Enjolras: Like hell we are. 

 

R: ill let you be elle and the gay guy

 

Enjolras: Excuse you his name is Nikos Argitakos. 

 

Épi-Pen: holy shit you’ve actually listened 

 

Enjolras: I had to look up what all of the lyrics meant but yes, I’ve listened. 

 

Jelly Belly: !!!!!!!!!!!

 

Jelly Belly: That’s amazing !!!!!

 

Enjolras: I really only disagree with one thing. 

 

Enjolras: “Depending on the time of day, the French go either way”. 

 

Enjolras: I hate to disappoint, but I only go one way. 

 

R: is this some convoluted way of telling me youre straight 

 

Enjolras: This is a convoluted way of joking that I am a homosexual. 

 

Marius: I Found It Funny

 

Enjolras: See, Marius found it funny. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: thats not something to be proud of

 

Enjolras: Well now you’re just being rude to Marius, and I cannot stand for this. 

 

Enjolras: Grantaire I thought you were coming over. 

 

R: yeah okay keep your pants on im coming

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: shouldnt you take ur pants off if ur coming 

 

Épi-Pen: gross

okay so im not actually 18 yet, but i found the tuna can a few months ago and im saving it until my birthday and YES i will crack it open and eat it

more meta/4th wall breaking because i crave it 

so i wrote the line “ This is a convoluted way of joking that I am a homosexual.” and i was CACKLING so i hope its actually funny and not just me 

eek the nice comments make me so happy, i love you all !!! 

:))))))

i have a love/hate relationship with this chapter

there are some funny things but at the same time i am not one to venture into the realm of writing smut so this is literally the closest i will ever get

an alternate title for this chapter is-the rumour come out: does courfeyrac is gay ?

also i would like to state that i was in home depot today so enjolras’ story is based on my own

thanks for the love as always and i hope you enjoy

Courfey-racks-on-racks: oh my god fine

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: yes 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: we did

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: but we were 15 at the time

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: happy ?

 

Enjolras: I’m not. 

 

Jehan: no i would like to know more

 

Enjolras: I’m still offering the Home Depot story. 

 

R: sorry babe ive already heard it

 

Enjolras: Don’t call me babe. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: thats not what you said 5 years ago

 

Enjolras: Yes, you’re right. 

 

Enjolras: I just told you to shut the fuck up. 

 

Enjolras: And you DIDN’T. 

 

Jehan: what rabbit hole have we fallen down

 

R: i don’t know but i hate it

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: fuck you 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: im going to tell the story

 

Enjolras: Well if memory serves, you’re already off to the wrong start. 

 

Jehan: what ?????

 

Enjolras: Courfeyrac said “fuck you” but if I remember correctly it was fuck YOU. 

 

Jehan: I HATE IT HERE

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: ok fine fuck me 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: but i mean the story isnt really that complicated despite how we make it seem

 

Enjolras: Courfeyrac was in love with Combeferre but Courfeyrac wasn’t sure if he was actually gay so he approached me and asked if we could have sex. 

 

Enjolras: I said yes because we were 15 and I didn’t think that it would come back to haunt me when I was 20. 

 

R: why would you agree to that

 

Enjolras: I DON’T KNOW STOP JUDGING ME

 

R: wait courf said something yesterday about you not being a bottom 

 

R: did you top him ?

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: in the most lax definition of the word, yes he did

 

R: what the fuck does that mean

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: u think that boy knows what hes doing ?

 

R: yeah okay fair

 

Enjolras: Rude. 

 

Jehan: does anyone else know ??

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: originally just ferre but now everyone i guess

 

R: tbh i wouldve expected you three to have had a threesome by now

 

Enjolras: Ew no. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: no thats weird

 

Jehan: oh and you two isnt ????

 

Enjolras: Incest is weirder. 

 

R: you two arent related 

 

Enjolras: We’re close enough. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: basically incest is weirder than homies helping homies

 

Enjolras: Please don’t refer to the incident as that. 

 

R: “the incident”

 

R: your making it sound like its a fucking murder

 

R: was it that bad ??

 

Enjolras: *You’re

 

R: yOuRe deflecting the question

Combeferre: I agree with Cosette

 

Jehan: im kinda surprised you just accepted it ferre 

 

Jehan: when did courf tell you

 

Combeferre: he came to me like a week later and he said something along the lines of

 

Combeferre: “So basically I had sex with Enjolras but I did it because I was having a sexuality crisis over you so I wanted to see if I was actually gay and yup I am and I think I love you”

 

Jehan: wow

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: well the jokes on him bc he said yes to a date

 

Combeferre: Enjolras may regret ever interacting with you but I only kind of do

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: i love u

 R   has logged off! 

 

i might give the home depot farmer his own chapter honestly, he was quite the guy

this is honestly probably the worst thing ive ever written but i also love it so much

its times like these that im happy i dont have a beta or anything because i want to spring these chapters out of nowhere and make people so confused 

id say this chapter has definitely the most ooc barricade boys, but at the same time, im not striving to be 100% accurate in this fic, in my other serious ones, yes i definitely take more time and put in more effort but this one is my personal “fuck you” to victor hugo

if you hate me after this chapter honestly that’s perfectly acceptable and im with you 100%

omg hi im back AGAIN 

im having so much fun

as requested, i put the Home Depot story in 

i hope you enjoy <3

(and yes every single story here is my own, i wish i could say they were made up)

 Chetta    has logged on! 

 

Chetta: I would love to hear your story

 

Enjolras: Thank you Musichetta. 

 

Enjolras: I’m talking about the Home Depot story. 

 

Enjolras: I was in Home Depot, looking for light fixtures, because I heard that Bossuet knocked one of the sconces off of his wall. 

 

Chetta: Oh were you the one who replaced that?

 

Enjolras: Yes I was. 

 

Chetta: Thank you :’)

 

Enjolras: Anytime. 

 

Enjolras: But I was in Home Depot, and I was very confused because I am confused in general by hardware stores. So I’m walking through the store, looking for the lighting, and I see this man standing in the middle of the store. 

 

Enjolras: He was a dictionary definition farmer.

 

Enjolras: He was wearing a straw hat, inside the store, and had on overalls with no sort of shirt. 

 

Enjolras: M. Farmer was standing in the middle of the store, with a singular can of spray paint, or bug spray, or something in a can, but he was just standing there shaking it and staring straight ahead. 

 

Enjolras: So I walked away from M. Farmer, and I turn a corner and I see a cowboy. 

 

Enjolras: I’m not sure if this man realised that we aren’t in Texas, but there was a fully decked out cowboy using a handsaw. 

 

Enjolras: At this point, I am now trapped between M. Cowboy and M. Farmer, so I turned and walked out of the store and went elsewhere for the sconce. 

 

R: legend says that the farmer is still there, shaking his singular can of spray paint 

 

Enjolras: Thank you for listening. 

 

Chetta: It was my pleasure 

 

Épi-Pen: the thing i miss most about america is the cowboys

 

R: yeah you cant see a cowboy with a revolver going to in-n-out in france now can you

Épi-Pen: that’s lower than i was expecting 

 

Enjolras: Number 1 is Macron. 

 

R: i dont think you can go around saying that enj 

 

Enjolras: Like that’s ever stopped me before. 

 

Enjolras: Number 2 is Boris Johnson. 

 

Bruh: what is with your inherent need to murder world leaders

 

Enjolras: Number 3 is Donald Trump. 

 

Épi-Pen: this is concerning 

 

Enjolras: Number 4 is the Monoprix lady. 

 

Bruh: wow okay you really cannot get over her

 

Enjolras: SHE CUT ME OFF IN THE PARKING LOT AND I ALMOST LOST MY LICENSE IT IS PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: wasn’t this 3 years ago 

 

Enjolras: Congratulations you have been moved up to 6th. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: WHAT NO WHY

 

Enjolras: Number 5 is the library guy. 

 

R: i feel as though you’ve already solved that problem 

 

Enjolras: Not enough. 

 

Épi-Pen: are any of us on there 

 

Enjolras: Grantaire was number 12 at one point. 

 

R: im going to wear that as a badge of honour

 

R: one time i made my way to number 2 on someone’s hit list 

 

R: i flirted my way up there, told him i loved him and bought him a dozen carnations for Valentine’s Day 

 

Épi-Pen: he only allegedly had one

 

R: yeah well i only aLlEgEdLy chugged a carton of school strawberry milk

 

Bruh: aren’t u lactose intolerant 

 

R: yes

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: genuine question 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: are you okay ?

 

R: i ask myself that everyday

 

R: the answer is usually no and then i go do more stupid shit

 

R: one time i fired an arrow off of my roof using a bow and it hit the store next to my house 

 

R: i also jumped off of the roof onto a very small pile of snow later in the year

V is for Van-Chetta: I need to make sure my boys are still alive 

 

V is for Van-Chetta: I’d suggest you do the same Enjolras 

 

Enjolras: Grantaire’s here and he's already talking about the time he highlighted his hair. 

 

Enjolras: Apparently the highlights were yellow and now he’s depressed.

also i advise against chugging a carton of milk if you’re lactose intolerant, it hurts

but thank you for all the kudos and comments and everything, even though im very clearly not a stable human being you guys love me and i love you back <3

okay this chapter was so much fucking fun to write

as always, any specific stories in this are my own, yes you should probably be worried 

i have work in like 7 hours but who needs sleep ?

Épi-Pen: you’re forgetting that neither of us happens to be named combeferre or feuilly 

 

R: are you implying that my boyfriend likes combeferre and feuilly more than me

 

Épi-Pen: oh no i'm not implying

 

Épi-Pen: i’m directly stating

 

R: okay but like ramin karimloo ???

 

R: enj likes him

 

R: he could look like ramin 

 

R: i think itd be hot 

 

Épi-Pen: it would be 

 

Épi-Pen: but it would also be pretty hot to keep all of my bones intact

Courfey-racks-on-racks: i agree w that enjy in eyeliner thing but lemme tell u abt my DAY

 

Épi-Pen: o no

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: so i went 2 the DOCTORS today

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: why tf i need to go there when im dating a sexy ass doctor is beyond me but 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: so i was in the office and the nurse practitioner hands some paper

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: the usual paperwork thats like “are u depressed” “do u have anger issues”

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: but then after that she gives me another piece of paper thats about “our growing bodies” and “a guide to adolescence”

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: my doctor also gave me a chickenpox shot because apparently the one i had when i was like 2 months old didn't ReGiStEr

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: she also asked if i drink alcohol but i was too distracted by her clogs to answer

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: they were bright purple

 

 Jehan    has logged on! 

 

Jehan: why does the word “bemused” mean confused

Épi-Pen: couldn’t tell you

 Combeferre    has logged on! 

 

Combeferre: Alright children, settle down

 

Bruh: ok dad

 

Jehan: alright dad

 

Foo Fighter: Okay pops

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: ok my love

 

Enjolras: No. 

 

Combeferre: Enjolras

 

Enjolras: I refuse to bow to an authoritative figure in my life. 

 

Enjolras: This is why I call my fathers by their names. 

 

R: enj pls just listen to the man

 

Enjolras: God FINE. 

 

Enjolras: I’ll settle down for you, daddy. 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: nO

 

Épi-Pen: fucking christ

 

Jehan: I. 

 

Jehan: HATE. 

 

Jehan: IT. 

 

Jehan: HERE. 

 

Enjolras: Anyways. 

 

Enjolras: Combeferre, please answer my question. 

 

Combeferre: Uh ???

 

Combeferre: It’s pretty damn illegal E

 

Enjolras: What if they don’t know it’s me. 

 

Foo Fighter: Why are you so pissed off at Macron

 

Enjolras: He said France needed a king. 

 

Bruh: yea like THREE YEARS AGO

 

Enjolras: And?

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: enj ur pure of heart dumb of ass honest to god 

 

Combeferre: I’m going to respond to each of you one at a time

 

Combeferre: Jehan, English is a very stupid language and many things don’t make sense in it

 

Combeferre: Bahorel, I’m sure you could find something interesting to show us

 

Combeferre: Feuilly, that’s how golf clubs tend to be; a lot of the time some old white man has to die in order for another middle-aged white man to replace him

 

Combeferre: Courf, Marius is not in the chat, but I think it would be a bad idea to get a dog

 

Combeferre: Also you can tell your health stories after I’m done

 

Combeferre: Enjolras

 

Combeferre: Where do I even start

 

Enjolras: Rude. 

 

Combeferre: You cannot assassinate Emmanuel Macron, because murder is illegal

 

Enjolras: Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being. Is it stated somewhere that it is illegal to kill Macron SPECIFICALLY. 

 

Combeferre: I don’t fucking know man, but it IS stated that you can’t kill people

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: can i tell my stories now 🥺

 

Combeferre: Yes you can sweetheart

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: so one time when i was 14 the doctors had to take blood to do blood tests and they took 5 vials at once and i fainted after the 2nd one 

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: also one time i had pneumonia and they gave me pills that were like

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: really big pills and i was 10 so i didnt kno how 2 swallow them 

 

R: you’re like me but with doctors instead of dentistry 

 

Épi-Pen: everyone here needs severe help

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: yup !

 

Enjolras: Combeferre Macron’s wife was 40 when he met her at age 15. 

 

Bruh: why are we still on this

 

Enjolras: BECAUSE IT’S WEIRD. 

 

Enjolras: IMAGINE IF I MARRIED M. LAMARQUE. 

 

Enjolras: WOULD THAT NOT BE STRANGE. 

 

Foo Fighter: Enj honey

 

Foo Fighter: Calm down 

 

Enjolras: Okay…

 

R: WHAT THE FUCK

 

R: feuilly can you convince enj to wear eyeliner 

 

R: bc apparently you alone can convince him to calm down 

 

Jehan: eyeliner enjolras ???

 

R :  ramin karimloo talked about it 

 

Bruh: what the fuck is Les Misérables 

 

Épi-Pen: that’s the book about the twinks right 

 

Jehan: no aren’t the sewers and churchmen the main characters

 

R: fuck victor hugo 

 

R: me n my homies HATE victor hugo 

 

Combeferre: I don’t think you’d really want to fuck Victor Hugo 

 

R: no i think i do

 

Enjolras: Didn’t he have sex with the entirety of Paris?

 

Combeferre: Probably!

 

Courfey-racks-on-racks: life goals honestly 

 

Enjolras: Isn’t Les Misérables about the June Rebellion?

 

Jehan: fucking probably 

 

Jehan: i think we should be asking what that book ISNT about

 

Enjolras: God I wish I was a rebel in the June Rebellion.

 

Foo Fighter: You know they lost right ??

 

Enjolras: What’s your point. 

 

R: noah fence babe but i think you’d probably get shot like

 

R: 8 times

 

Enjolras: Rude. 

 

Bruh: ok but like really what is it

 

Combeferre: A movie based on a musical based on a book where a small amount is about the June Rebellion of 1832 and the rest is about fuck all

 

Épi-Pen: would you care to hear about Waterloo

 

Bruh: that sounds awful who would read that 

 

R: haha yeah who’d do that

 

R: you, that’s who 

 

Foo Fighter: Who ?

 

R: oh you know 

 

Foo Fighter: I really don’t

okay but the thing w bahorel and him not sending anything actually happened lmao

my best friend texted me at like 3 am and this is how my convo w him went-him: Bruh wannna see somethingme: surehim: I literally had nothing to show I dont even fucking know why I asked you thatGenuinely I have no idea why I sent that textme: what the fuck

also yeah courf’s stories are my own (so is Feuilly’s) i was at the dr’s today and she gave a piece of paper about “our growing bodies” and then she was like “oh wait you’re 15 you don’t really need that do you”

did i project my own feelings about macron onto enj ?? yeahdo i think he’d agree ?? double yeah

i had so much fun getting meta lmao, and i would suggest clicking the links because they lead to fun stuff

thank you all for the support and i will continue to love everyone forever <333

sorry is this one kinda short ? it seems like it but idk

the lobster roll story is my own, and i just wanna say GOD BLESS YOU 

seriously im going to worship her as a goddess now because she’s literally the best coworker on the planet

so usually i just base grantaire off of the shit i do but in this chapter i reaaaaaaally just made myself courf because while i don’t smoke weed or drink (i think id prolly die cause like meds n shit) this is honestly just how i act regularly 

can you find where i quoted the brick ???

Courfey-racks-on-racks

Courfey-racks-on-racks
: who ???


 


Combeferre

R
: oh my god is it actually 


 


Combeferre
: Yes it is and he is beyond pissed 


 


Jehan
: what happened ??


 



Enjolras


 has logged on!



 


Combeferre
: Here he comes


 


Enjolras
: “What happened??” asks dear Prouvaire, concern, yet also a hint of fear, evident in his tone despite only sending those two words; and through next nonetheless! Text, though a difficult such medium to express emotion through, has been clearly mastered by the poet of the group Les Amis de l’ABC, a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are sometimes serious factors in politics; witness the Castratus ad castra, which made a general of the army of Narses; witness: Barbari et Barberini; witness: Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram, etc., etc. But, I shall digress from that and bring the matter back to my hand. 


 


R
: are you done being melodramatic yet


 


Enjolras
: You’re number six Grantaire, I wouldn’t speak if I were you. 


 


Combeferre
: I thought Courf was 6


 


Enjolras
: Oh he was. 


 


Enjolras
: Not anymore. 


 


Jehan
: as much as i love the whole victor hugo thing you've got going, can you tell us what happened 


 


Enjolras
: I’ll tell you what fucking happened. 


 


Enjolras
: Today someone decided that it’s officially “Spill as many things on Enjolras as physically possible” day. 


 


R
: yikes


 


Jehan
: oh he’s typing


 


Jehan
: oh man


 


R
: enj you’ve been typing for a while


 


R
: you good ??


 


Combeferre
: He’s currently alternating banging on the bathroom door and typing


 


Combeferre
: I can actually hear his fingers hitting the screen


 


Enjolras
: It’s a great day, a lovely day, I’m having a great time, and I’m covered in paint and coffee and other various drinks and probably chemicals as well; Professor Myriel decided that today was a lab day that we were using liquids for and fucking MARIA, the Corsican girl was paired up with me and spilt shit all over me, because Corsicans are the actual worst; they’re not patriotic at all, everyone there is honestly just kind of a bitch; why Pontmercy ever thought that they were important is beyont me; but I digress; so I was thinking that It would be wonderful to actually go home and take a shower because having chemicals all over you is actually very dangerous and a HEALTH HAZARD, but apparently Joly has decided he’s done with everyone’s bullshit so I can’t even use him as a driving force to get Courfeyrac out of my fucking bathroom, so I can clean myself and make sure I don’t get some sort of terminal fucking illness, so I’d love it if someone could let me take a shower because at this rate I’ll never get in so I fucking give up.

hi i don’t support shane dawson and i am aware that the context of the r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼♀️ is pretty racist and also transphobic but i wanna let y’all know that i just find it funny and yeah, keep shane dawson cancelled pls i never liked him

anyways there’re like 89 kudos on this ?? that’s just crazy honestly, thank you guys because just whoah

Enjolras’ long ass sentence about his day is 195 words long so im honestly just trying to make vicky proud 

also okay, im gonna be writing a jekyll and hyde au (Based on the book) because i have no self control, so here’s me planning out who’s who-if you actually read the end notes, feel free to weigh in on itJekyll - enjolrasHyde - MontparnasseLanyon- GrantaireUtterson- CombeferreSir Danvers Carew- ClaquesousEnfield- idk yetPoole- maybe Feuilly ?Guest- either Marius or courfeyrac 

so yeah if you read that and wanna tell me who tf would possibly fit Enfield you’ll be my saviour (maybe javert ??)

thank you all for reading i love you all <33

so i meant to have this up a few days ago, on bastille day but it is currently 1 am on July 16th soooo

god work was hell today, like i had a 7 hour shift on 4 hours of sleep

Enjolras

Combeferre

Enjolras

Marius
: Did You Forget Your Own Birthday??


 


R

Courfey-racks-on-racks
: ugh TYPING


 


V is for Van-Chetta
: If anything happens, I declare right now, that I have done nothing wrong


 


Cassette
: You type so slowly 


 


Enjolras
: Yes Marius, I did forget that it was my birthday. Consequently, I also forgot that it was Cosette’s. But in the grand scheme of the world, these little things are all for naught. There is no need to celebrate a singular person’s date of birth. We ought to celebrate the birth of a new republic on the 14th of July, 1789. 


 


Enjolras
: Also fuck you. 


 


R
: fun fact 


 


R
: i don’t know why the 4th of july is America’s national holiday


 


R
: something about thomas jefferson and weed paper


 


V is for Van-Chetta
: Yeah that sounds right 


 


Combeferre
: “The birth of a new republic”


 


Combeferre
: You are aware that everyone, including Robespierre, were guillotined 


 


Enjolras
: Yes well it’s the thought that counts. 


 


Cassette
: Sure


 


Cassette
: Anyways, I’m gonna go, because me and Ép are grabbing lunch, since neither of us forgot it’s our birthday 


 


R
: hey listen im not the one who forgot 


 


V is for Van-Chetta
: That doesn’t make the situation any better honey


 


Enjolras
: Okay but really, why is it such a big deal? Woohoo, I’m turning 21. That’s just one more year that’s gone by that there’s still injustice in the world. The upper classes are living off of the poor; nothing has changed. Emmanuel Macron said we needed a king, so why not bring back the national razor and let him see what it’s like to have a king? 


 


R
: each year is just a reminder that macron married a former teacher of his 


 


Enjolras
