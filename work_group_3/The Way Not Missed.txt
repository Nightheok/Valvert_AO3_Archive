The Way Not Missed --


I walked the valley of my birth, steeped in my fate's bitterness.
Life had bent my hand to no other weapon but my hate.
Then God and mercy led me to this cherished second chance:
Great as my hatred was, I know now a love twice again as great.

Every cold word of mine you returned with a gentle glance
Warmed with your pulse's impassioned throb, with your heart's leap.
Until the hidden days, the moments fleeting, false, and stinging,
Were repaid in nights of pleasure, wondrous and true and deep.

Bitter as our hatred was, old and rigid and unchanging,
To alter its ruinous course would be to change night to day.
But as pride to prayer was its bitterness transformed to sweetness --
And we found that love had, at our lives' end, not missed its way.
