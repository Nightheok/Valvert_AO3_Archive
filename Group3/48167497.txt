Hi everyone! The pool will not be open for another week due to continued maintenance on the children’s slide. Have a great summer! 😎☀️ #summer fun


@msmpolice


Please be advised that there will be absolutely consumption or distribution alcoholic beverages on the decks or in the parking lot of the public pool. We are trying to avoid a repeat of last year’s “incident”.


@gardenidol


Remember last summer when those university students got super drunk and declared an Independent Republic of Pooltopia? That was incredible


@maddydaddy69


I’m sure you all remember when Mayor Madeleine came down to the pool himself…the situation would only have been improved if he had taken off the swim shirt….


@gardenidol


Holy shit can a man not post ANYTHING with the madeleine thirst accounts jumping down his throat? 😂


@maddydaddy69


Apparently not <3


@msmmayor


This week, we’re promoting local small businesses! Lola of @crochetcween  makes fantastic plushies and apparel by hand here in town. Check her out! 🧶 #shop small


@FFfrancois


Do you guy think that if I mailed Madeline a crochet crop top he’d wear it? Like, in public?


@maddydaddy69


Genius as usual, Francois. One of us needs to get on this ASAP.


@msmpolice


Please be advised that sending clipping from magazines of an “inappropriate” nature to station addressed to one of our Inspector’s is, while legal, not respectful or. An investigation is on going.


@infamousgisette


Ok guys, who was mailing javert porno cut outs?


@slimeviolent


I was!!


@gardenidol


Me too


@infamousgisette


Me too. Shit, no wonder he got pissed off


@FFfrancois


Well I, for one, think it’s disgusting, disgraceful, and despicable behavior!


@slimeviolent


Ooh the narc’s here!


@FFfrancois


This is a public platform. Get wrecked. And I am certainly NOT a “narc”.


@msmmayor


Good afternoon! A women’s garment has been mailed to mairie by mistake. Please message us if you believe the garment is yours, and if you can describe it, we will ship to you free of charge. :) #helpusout


@maddydaddy69


The garment is a crocheted bikini tap in baby blue with white daisy. Very tasteful. Shows off the cleavage. It was, of course, intended for Monsieur le Maire himself.


@msmmayor


UPDATE: the owner of the women’s garment has not come forward. It will be donated to charity! Thanks, everyone!😁

@msmpmayorHello! Inspector Javert of Montreuil Sur Mer’s finest would like to remind all of you that continuing to mail him disturbing and bizarre images is not a pleasant and community minded thing to do! Thanks so much for your cooperation! 😊 #neighbors

@silmeviolentHis ass did NOT say “pleasant and community minded”

@maddydaddy69Do you all know whose ass is pleasant?

@slimeviolentNo, maddydaddy69, I do not. Would you like to tell me? Using as much detail as possible of course.

@maddydaddy69THIS TWEET MAY CONTAIN SENSITIVE CONTENT


@msmpolice


Sometimes I think about my head being squeezed between Mayor Madeleine’s gorgeous, succulent, beautiful breasts. #manwhoremonday


@infamousgisette


@slimeviolent @gardenidol BREAKING NEWS


@gardenidol


NO WAY


@slimeviolent


Im in tears #manwhoremonday ????????????


@gardenidol


@msmmayor you ought to see this

(DIRECT MESSAGES)


@henriccrossfit


Javert. What just happened?


@msmpolice


Chabouillet. Shit. I am so, so sorry. It was an honest mistake.


@henriccrossfit


How? A mistake how?


@msmpolice


Well

I had another account

Actually, I had two


@henriccrossfit


I gathered that. “Maddydaddy69”. What the fuck, Javert?


@msmpolice


And FFfrancois


@henriccrossfit


I’d advise keeping your mouth shut until I get myself to Montreuil to deal with this.

I vouched for you, Javert. This is insanity.

 


(See the end of the chapter for notes.)


@msmmayor:

Hello, is this Inspector Javert? 👋


@maddydaddy69:


Yes

@msmmayor:

What is the meaning of all this?


@maddydaddy69:


I

Uh

Is that…not clear?

@msmmayor:

I’m not sure


@maddydaddy69:


Look, Madeleine, I’m getting absolutely torn apart publicly on twitter right now, my mentor is coming out here to drag me back to Paris by the scruff of my neck, and so I might as well just tell you that the meaning was I think you are extremely attractive.

@msmmayor:

Oh. I hadn’t gathered that.


@maddydaddy69:


What? How? I posted some really gross edits of you.

And the fan art

And the other fake account and the PO Box from whence I mailed you the crop top

@msmmayor:

I must admit that I’m not incredibly familiar with internet culture, such as it is. I thought that this might be the case but I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt. Still, it’s not a crime. There’s nothing against the law about posting the occasional “thirsty Thursday”. Unethical, certainly, but that’s different.


@maddydaddy69:


That’s exactly what I’m saying. Listen, I know I’ve violated every possible professional boundary, but I have to ask you one last favor. Some of your famed mercy I guess.

@msmmayor:

Of course 👍


@maddydaddy69:


Would you please fire me?

@msmmayor:

Absolutely not.


@maddydaddy69:


Pardon my language, but why the fuck not?

@msmmayor:

Because it’s not right. Because we are both flawed people.


@maddydaddy69:


You? A flawed person? Come on, you’re the hero of Montreuil-sur-Mer. You’ve cleaned he place up and everyone worships the ground you walk on.

And since you’ve already seen my terrible private accounts, I would add that I do too.

@msmmayor:

That’s very kind. 🥺

You were a CO at Toulon before coming here, right?


@maddydaddy69:


Yeah

Why do you ask?

@msmmayor:

I thought so. And you also think I am “extremely attractive?”


@maddydaddy69:


Yes I did say that. No need to lord It over me.

I would really appreciate if you could fire me. In shame. It would be just and it would be fucking merciful.

@msmmayor:

I disagree. That would not be any kind of justice.


@maddydaddy69:


No disrespect, but clearly you know nothing of justice.

@msmmayor:

You’re wrong again.

I have to ask you a favor of my own. Can you come to the Marie, as soon as you can? I need to show you some thing. Call it proof of how much of justice I really know.


@maddydaddy69:


Fine.

I’lll be there in 20 minutes.


@msmpolice


Please be advised: the fugitive Jean Valjean is at large in the Montreal Sur Mer area. Keep doors and windows locked and be on the look out. He is not armed, but he is dangerous.

 

UGH ok there we go. Not my fave but had to get it out. Wish i had made Francois into @monsieurlebear, but you live and you learn.
