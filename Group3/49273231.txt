Work text:


(See the end of the chapter for notes.)


In truth, Javert was never one to be interested in a relationship. He could barely imagine himself in one. It wasn’t as if he had anything about him that would be desirable. He had a scowl permanently etched upon his face, eyebrows furrowed into a frown, with sharp striking eyes and just an overall unattractive appearance. And he had no need for a relationship in the first place. He was rather more connected to his work than any other person.

He had gone to work as usual, and sat at his desk, booting up his computer. 

“Early again, I see.” a voice came from Javert’s side, his superior, Gisquet. 

Javert, despite having a dislike of interacting with people, still held his superiors in high regard. No matter how migraine-inducing talking to them is. 

“I wouldn’t want to be late for my duty, sir.” he replied curtly. 

“Alright then, I won’t bother you now, off you go to your tasks.” Gisquet said, waving his hand and walking away.

Javert’s stomach grumbled, he hadn’t stopped to get any take-out from where he usually does, he simply grabbed a coffee and went straight to the station.

If only he hadn’t been such a shit cook, he would’ve cooked food the day before and just brought the already-made food to the station to eat at his desk.

It wasn’t long until the police station was bustling with work and chatter. Javert had been working non-stop since he sat down, only ever getting up to grab another coffee. 

To his coworkers, Javert was known to be someone they’d call a “workaholic”. He was one of the most dedicated people in the station, which gained him the respect he has today. 

However, he was an intimidating person. Not just to his coworkers, even to civilians and criminals alike. He had an air around him that seemed like an invisible wall, separating him from any other person, which made him unapproachable. His intimidating persona and towering height made him the infamous Javert miscreants have come to fear.

Except for a select few people, like his superiors. “Javert, you’re being reassigned for your patrol for a couple months. We’ve gotten a couple cases of theft and robbery in that area and I trust your expertise in this.” said Gisquet. 

Javert was given a file after he’d nodded in acknowledgement of Gisquet’s request, after skimming on the cases known as of now, he did his own personal research on the area. It was a nice busy square with shops and restaurants around, a popular tourist spot.

He dreads having to deal with tourists, it’s inevitable that they were going to ask for help in directions and such but it is his duty to patrol in that area so it must be done.

He’d gone home after working late hours at the station, boiling some water and preparing another dinner of instant noodles. His paycheck wasn’t as great to afford take-out from fast-food restaurants, not with the inflation in the economy, and he couldn’t cook, at all, not even if his life depended on it.

So he resorted to only ever eating the occasional cup noodles because how could someone even mess up boiling water? Javert has. Despite his meticulous work in perfecting everything he did, anything related to cooking was his greatest weakness.

He’d often zone out as he waited for the water to boil. On this day, his thoughts drifted to the past. Montreuil-sur-Mer, where he was assigned to be an inspector with the local police. Then he thought of the events in Toulon, when he first started off his career as a prison guard. 

One thing in common in all of his thoughts was of one man, a man who had haunted his thoughts throughout the years. His name was Jea– The sound of the kettle whistling cut off his thoughts, he shook his head as if to remove them from his mind.

constructive criticism needed please hwlp

An unfortunate meeting. (at least for Javert :3)


(See the end of the chapter for notes.)


Javert had been dispatched officially in his new assigned area, and he was correct about his assumptions of having to deal with unwanted interaction with tourists.

It was a good thing, however, that Javert was well versed in not just the language of the French but in many others. 

He noticed one thing in particular that came up often with their questions: they asked about a certain restaurant, one that Javert had read about online when he researched about the area.

He took some interest in it and decided to go there after his patrol that night, after all, it was his payday and he was looking to give himself a little treat.

When he arrived, the restaurant was busy indeed, with waiters going around, providing assistance to the customers, working dutifully around the restaurant like busy bees. He was sitting at a table that had a violet cover with flowers in it’s design.

This place truly felt exquisite, unfamiliar to Javert who only went to places like this during gatherings of the precinct to celebrate events. There were also flowers in the middle, beautiful cornflowers, also known as “bleuets”. Javert felt out of place, everyone else around him had someone with them at their tables, yet he was alone.

He received the menu shortly and began skimming through. The restaurant had been quite packed, a line was forming outside, since it was already late in the evening. Suddenly, he heard a voice he thought he was imagining behind him.

“Cosette, you really didn’t have to bring me with you and Marius..” a soft voice said, reluctantly. 

“It’s alright Papa, me, and Marius talked it out and we decided to invite you of our own accord, we haven’t talked in ages after all!” replied a cheery woman’s voice. 

“Here is your table, messieurs, and madame– Oh my! I’m sorry, I didn’t know there was someone already sitting here!” said the waitress, Javert had dropped the menu on the table with a look of bewilderment, unsure if the face before him was one of reality or an illusion created by his fatigued mind.

There before him was fucking Valjean. The very man of his nightmares. The one who haunts his every wake and step. He was right in front of him, and he was screaming internally, frozen in place by shock.

“..Javert?” was the first word to come out of that damned mouth. Valjean had grown old with age, just as Javert had.

Valjean’s build was almost similar to how Javert remembered him to be. Only now, the hairs on his head shone a silver color, almost glowing in the restaurant light.

“Papa? You know this man?” said the blonde woman, presumably ‘Cosette’.

“Yes.. I do. I’ve known him for years. I haven’t met him in a while though.” The man pursed his lips slightly in a tight-lipped smile, recalling his last memories of Javert.

 “It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” Valjean said, turning towards Javert who was still sitting at the table. Javert snapped back to his senses, his eyes snapping towards the source, and he was reminded once again of his circumstances. 

“Yes… it has been a while, Valjean.” he said, feeling his insides boil with resentment, rising from its restless slumber that irked him to no end with a constant reminder supplied by his own subconscious that he had let a criminal free, and said criminal stood audaciously right in front of him.

“I truly do apologize for having this mix-up..” The waitress says, breaking the tension and bowing towards a well-dressed man, who Javert assumed was ‘Marius’, with Cosette’s arm around his right.

“No, it’s quite alright. We can still wait, right, my dear? You wouldn’t mind either, would you, Monsieur Valjean?” Marius said, flashing an understanding smile towards his beloved and his father-in-law.

“I don’t mind at all!” Cosette said cheerily. “Then that settles it..” said Marius. The pair walked away with the waitress, Except for Valjean who slightly lagged behind.

“Oh, Javert, it’s been nice seeing you again.. I hope you’re doing well.” Valjean said, turning around and addressing Javert yet again.

The fucking audacity. His daughter and son-in-law walked away with the waiter, probably going back to wait on a new table.

“Yeah, I’ve been doing really great.” Javert said, his voice laced with disdain, allowing his lips to form a grimace now that it was just the two of them.

Valjean picked up on the tone in Javert’s voice and felt a pang shoot through his body, and he fiddled with the sleeve of his left arm. “I’m.. really sorry for what had happened in the past, Javert.”

Javert narrowed his eyes at Valjean, how dare he apologize after all these years? Javert simply picked back up the menu he’d dropped on the table and read through it, not wanting to bother dealing with Valjean. He came here to treat himself, and he won’t let him of all things deprive him of that pleasure.

Valjean let out a sigh, letting his shoulders go slack. “I just.. I just wanted to say that I forgive you.” And with that, he finally left him alone. Despite that, his words lingered in Javert’s mind. ‘What did he mean by that..?’.

Javert had ordered something that was on the ‘loved’ list on the menu. There was a wide variety of options, yet he couldn’t decide on which he would indulge himself with and just decided on trying the signature seafood plate that he’d spotted other customers ordered when he looked around him.

Javert didn’t know what to expect from the seafood, after all, he hadn’t been able to get his hands on any during the majority of his life because it at his original post, there was no nearby sea so the prices of seafood items at the market was at a value too high for his standards, so he simply stuck to his usual foods like the instant noodles.

After taking his order, the waiter strode away towards the kitchen. Javert took out his phone and scrolled through his emails and checked if there were any reports on any crimes made or if any articles were posted about any suspicious activity around this area.

Even at a time like this, alone at a restaurant table, Javert still thought of his work. He couldn’t help it after all, he had this.. itching feeling constantly seeking the need to execute justice.

His thoughts were quickly interrupted by an ear piercing voice (at least in his opinion) talking from the table beside him. He looked away from his phone subtly and there he was yet again. Valjean.

Javert had hoped that he wouldn’t have to be in his vicinity yet again but it couldn’t really be helped. It was a Friday night, and the restaurant was buzzing with people coming in for dinner. ‘He’d just ignore him, easy as that.’ Javert thought to himself, averting his eyes from the table where he was at.

However.. fate had different plans. Little did Javert know that he would later have an allergic reaction after consuming the seafood plate and end up waking up in a hospital room.

CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WOULD BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED. THANK YEW.

omg hospital chapter 🤯


(See the end of the chapter for notes.)


Dark eyelashes fluttered open, slowly adjusting to the lights above him. A searing headache slowly crept in, and Javert held his head with his hand. ‘What happened..?’

The last thing he could recall was him receiving the seafood plate and feeling light headed after a couple bites. He looked up to an analog clock beside the door, it’s been already a couple hours since he first went into the restaurant.

Suddenly he heard voices from outside the door, and he laid back down, trying to piece together what could have occurred at the restaurant for him to end up here. 

The door opened, and a doctor walked in, holding a clipboard. “Ah, so you’re awake now.” he said, walking towards the bedside, writing some things down. 

“Your name is Javert, correct?”

“Yes, that is correct. Doctor, if I may ask, how did I end up here? My.. memory feels hazy and I can’t recall how I even got here.” Javert said, still wracking his brain.

“Well Javert, you came in here due to an allergic reaction, anaphylaxis more specifically.” 

Javert felt even more baffled, how could he have an allergic reaction, what could he have eaten and not know he had an allerg- Then it clicked. The seafood plate, it was the first time he could recall ever eating seafood, and since he never tried it in the past, he really couldn’t have known.

But one question was still left unanswered. “Doctor, how did I.. get here?”

The doctor hummed for a moment, before answering. “You were brought here by a man who was near your table and had seen you, he said his name was Jean Valjean, I believe. He’s currently outside, would you like me to call hi-”

“No, that’s quite alright Doctor. I..” he paused, and the doctor looked up at him, retracting his attention from his clipboard.

“I don’t want to see that fucking Valjean and have it rub it in that I have a god-forsaken allergy.” is what Javert would’ve liked to say, however he decided against it and instead mustered out a strained:

“I don’t want to be a bother.” He just really didn’t want to see him.

A knock on the door interrupts the silence, and the door slides open, revealing a worried looking Valjean. Javert couldn’t help but let out a groan. ‘Speak of the devil and he doth appear’, or so they say.

“Oh thank the heavens you’re awake Javert.. I was so worried. Doctor, how is he doing?” Valjean said, fully entering the room now, going towards the doctor as he asked his question.

“His status has stabilized compared to how he was when he first entered, he’d be good to go after some more adequate rest.” The doctor finished, then excused himself, there were still more patients to tend to after all.

Silence overtook the room’s tension, Javert refused to meet Valjean’s eyes. After more moments of silence, he finally gave in and broke it.

“Weren’t you at dinner with your.. daughter?”

“Ah, Cosette?” Javert simply nodded his head, he was looking outside the window, it seemed like it was a full moon tonight. He wondered how the air felt like out there.

“After some convincing I managed to leave her and Marius stay at the restaurant. It would be quite a waste if they ended up canceling their reservation at that restaurant because I was worried..” Valjean let out a soft laugh, but soft enough to be heard in the quiet room.

“Well you heard the doc, I’m fine, you don’t need to worry anymore, you can go.” ‘go and leave me the fuck alone’ is what Javert thought, but he felt too tired to outwardly curse out the man in the hospital room. 

Valjean nodded, and before slipping out of the room again, he called out to Javert. The light from outside the door draped gently over Valjean, compared to Javert, who was shrouded in darkness from the darker part of the room.

“Javert?” Javert finally turned his head, looking back at Valjean, waiting and expecting an answer.

A pause.. then a soft “I’m happy you’re okay.” was uttered, before Valjean disappeared with a click of the door.

He was happy Javert was okay? Valjean, happy about Javert? Maybe the anaphylaxis was still affecting Javert and he heard wrong.. right?

had to search stuff ab anaphylaxis for this chapterrgrghahhahahh

sorry again it's short I'm not a man of many words mb.... /j

I'M TRYING MY BEST!!!!!!

unfortunate meeting pt 2 :333


(See the end of the chapter for notes.)


The day after the incident, Javert returned to work the next day, walking into the office, returning to familiarity. It was just one meeting. In this big city, surely they wouldn’t end up bumping into each other again, right?

Javert surely hoped not. There were new cases to file into the police records, only a couple minor incidents such as petty theft at a nearby mall and vandalism. He busied himself, writing new documents to record them into the system.

Hours ticked by, and soon the station had gone quiet, only a few officers passing by here and there, with tired eyes and a cup of coffee or a soda from the vending machine.

Javert had decided to go home, and after packing up his few things in his bag, he slung it over his shoulder, exiting the station. When he’d arrived home, he felt his stomach grumble, looking at the clock it was already 9pm, he put away his things and walked toward his cupboard.

Opening it, his eyes widened and he let out a tsk, he was out of noodles, and he didn’t really have any other foods he was capable of eating. The cereal wasn’t going to cut it for dinner, so he decided to just go out again, and restock his food source.

It was a good thing that only a couple blocks away was a grocery shop, he frequented there often, and for this day, he was happy it was open 24/7. 

Entering the grocery, the bell dinged above him, and he laid his eyes on a teen on his phone, not paying any mind to who just entered the store. 

‘Kids these days..’ he thought to himself, internally shaking his head at the lack of responsibility.

Passing by some shelves, he went toward the section where the pastas and noodles were, grabbing his favorite brand and putting them in a basket.

Soon after he got all his groceries, not paying attention to any other late shoppers, he directed himself to the cashier, who had two people waiting in line, one of them even wearing some clothes that were subtly pajamas.

He lined up and scrolled on his phone, unaware of the person in front of him turning to the side and catching a glimpse of the man behind him.

“Javert?” his eyes shot up from his phone, blinking rapidly at the man who was in front of him. There he was, in his casual glory, fucking Valjean.

“What are you doing here?” Javert quipped, irritated that he somehow ended up bumping into him, only a day after their last meeting in the hospital.

Valjean brought up an arm, holding up his basket of groceries, the corner of his wretched mouth, curling slightly upwards.

“I wanted to cook something for breakfast tomorrow, so.. I went here to buy the items needed.” he sheepishly said, pushing away the awareness of Javert’s eyes burning a hole into his skull.

If Javert’s eyes burned like the lasers they felt like, Valjean would’ve been dead on the floor by now.

“Ah.. how are you feeling by the way?” Valjean said, trying to be polite.

“Why do you care?” Javert spat, his face forming a grimace, his eyebrows stitching together.

Why did he of all things have to be here? Is this some cruel joke being played on Javert, to have the man who mentally haunted him for years suddenly be present where he went?

“I was just concerned about you, after I saw you at the restaurant yesterday, I-” Javert’s sharp glare towards Valjean stopped him from continuing his sentence.

Valjean’s eyes were drawn to the basket that Javert held (with a death grip), filled with instant noodles and a couple other things such as cereal and coffee.

“I didn’t know you liked noodles.” Valjean said, wanting to divert the conversation.

However, Javert thought his words were of belittlement. Valjean’s basket, in comparison to Javert’s, was filled with healthy-looking vegetables and foods that would certainly be filling and more beneficial to the human body than the garbage in Javert’s.

He didn’t want to admit that noodles were the only thing he knew how to cook so he simply replied quickly,

“Is there something wrong with liking them?” raising an eyebrow through his grimace.

Valjean raised a hand shaking it in defense, “No, no, no, I didn’t mean it like that!” he gushed out worriedly.

Javert felt himself grin internally at making Valjean worried. But their conversation was interrupted, when the teen in front said 

“Next customer,” a pause, then added a forced “please.” with the roll of his eyes.

The line moved forward, their conversation over. Thank god. Javert felt as though he was about to sucker punch the teeth out of Valjean if he had to see his perfect fucking pearly whites more with every word he said.

Valjean simply glanced back at Javert one last time before taking his groceries and leaving.

I swear it's gonna be a slow burn I'm tryna figure it out as I go bare w me,,

CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OR ANY WORDS WILL BE APPRECIATED AGAINNNN :33333

next chapter might be in JVJ's pov this time :D

jean valjean pov chapter?!?!?


(See the end of the chapter for notes.)


Valjean exited the grocery store, feeling the cold air graze his skin. With every step he took, he thought of the events that had occurred in just these two short days.

First of all, he ended up getting invited to a ‘dinner date’ that was meant to be just between his daughter Cosette, and her husband, Marius.

And despite his apprehension, they brought him along for dinner, at a fancy restaurant that had become popular with the locals.

But behind all of that, he ended up crossing paths with someone he’d never expect to see, not after the situation that had occurred nearly half a decade ago. Javert.

The stars in the sky twinkled in empathy, as if they could hear the thoughts of Jean Valjean.

He'd arrived soon later at his home, he had recently changed locations due to complicated reasons, and now he was in an unfamiliar apartment building.

With a soft 'click' he entered, putting away his groceries in the refrigerator, and wherever he thought it belonged.

He still hadn't met his neighbors, his apartment was the one furthest at the hallway, so he only really had one, the apartment adjacent to his.

The silence in his apartment was deafening and claustrophobic, he ended up stepping foot on the balcony, feeling the cold air of the wind gently caress the hairs on his arms and exposed areas of his skin.

What was he doing with his life? His daughter had moved out three years ago and was already married yet he was turning 47 this year, still alone.

Holding his head in his hands, he listened to the sounds of the wind, breathing in the cold air.

He should get a job. Even just to busy himself. He still had left-over money from the times he acted as M. Madeline, but he didn't want to just stay at home alone, staring at the empty, blank walls.

'Tomorrow' he said to himself, tomorrow was the day he would do something with his life.

I wrote most of this chapter on my phone, much apologies if there's smth goofy

I don't get google docs on mobile ☠️

this is also like a setup for next chapter SORRRYRYRYR

valjean gets a job!


(See the end of the chapter for notes.)


Valjean stirred in his bed, the sun shining through his window blinds. The clock at his side read: 6am.

He got ready, brushed his teeth, ate some breakfast, and..

How does he even apply for a job?

When he was younger, he recalled they would post a “Help Wanted” advertisement in the newspaper, but he doubts people would do something like that these days.

Valjean decided to try just walking around, exploring the area more.

He hadn’t exactly done so since moving into his new apartment, because he was preoccupied with moving his possessions.

Slipping on his boots, he looked back at his empty apartment one last time, before entering the hallway.

It was still early in the morning, so he didn't expect his neighbors to exactly be out and about.

He walked toward the elevator, and with a 'ding', its doors opened.

Yet just as the doors were about to close and descend, a voice called out.

"Hold the door please!"

Valjean pressed on the button to hold open the door, but he didn't exactly prepare to face whoever stood in front of him at the doorway.

Javert was neatly dressed in a police uniform, his long silver hair tied up in a slick ponytail, not a single stray strand in sight.

Valjean, in comparison, was wearing a casual turtleneck and a brown overcoat.

A grimace almost instantaneously formed on the face of Javert, his eyes darkening, pursing his lips in disdain.

Valjean, on the other hand, felt antsy, unsure of what to say.

This was the third time they bumped into each other, the coincidences were starting to become unnerving.

Javert silently stepped into the elevator, choosing to ignore Valjean.

The elevator doors closed, silent tension drowning the two in the enclosed space.

Valjean felt like he was about to throw up.

The silence was only broken now and then with the sound of the elevator, passing a floor.

By the time it finally reached the ground floor, which felt like it took hours, Javert quickly stepped out of the elevator, not bothering to give Valjean a second glance.

Valjean watched Javert's quickly retreating figure and let out a breath of relief, allowing the tension in his shoulders to slip out.

What a way to start the day.

Valjean composed himself, then finally exited the apartment building.

The streets weren't as busy as they usually were, checking his watch, the time read 7:32 am.

Some shops should be open by now, maybe he could stop by somewhere for a cup of coffee?

After checking online, there was a nearby café that was right beside the park.

It was called "Sucrerie & Café". Apparently it wasn't just a café, it was partly a bakery as well.

Entering the establishment, the aroma of cinnamon, cardamom, and coffee wafted into Valjean's senses.

The café wasn't entirely silent, only a few people were scattered among the tables, working on either a laptop or simply paying attention to whatever they had on their table.

Walking up to the cashier, Valjean contemplated what he would decide to order.

"Bonjour Monsieur, what would you like to order?" the cashier said, looking up towards Valjean.

Valjean looked up at the menu, pondering on what he’d like. “I.. would like a café au lait and a lemon tart please.”

“Alright sir, that’ll be €11.98, please wait a moment for your order to be made. Thank you for supporting the Sucrerie & Café.” the cashier smiled, and Valjean found a seat in a corner of the café.

Turning to the side, he studied the other things written on the menu, and something caught his eye.

There was a clear sign in the top left corner, saying “BAKER WANTED!” Maybe today isn’t as bad as he thought.

Valjean was never a proper baker, but when he was younger, he would help around at a bakery, baking some loaves of bread in order to have a supply of food for his family.

He wasn’t paid, but he received the experience to use in the long run.

He sent an email to the one that was listed in the sign yesterday. Waking up to a new day, he checked his phone for the time and saw he received an email back; coming from the café he had visited.

Returning to the bakery again the day after, he did a trial run of how’d he’d be the baker, baking some of their simpler recipes and other more complicated ones (with some help, of course).

The manager of the café nodded in approval and discussed with Valjean properly about the job, and Valjean gladly took the position.

From now on, he was Jean Valjean, a baker.
