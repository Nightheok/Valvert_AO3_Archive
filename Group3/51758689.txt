Work text:

The best part was not the police inspector’s hand roughly jerking him to completion. No, it was when Marius moaned, and the other man ran his tongue briefly along his lips. He knew Javert could taste himself on his mouth. When Javert’s grip on his jaw tightened, he also knew he liked it. Afterwards, as Javert licked the boy’s seed from his broad palm, the student heard him say, “It would suit you to grow a beard.” Neither of them had looked at the Toulon letters on the desk, but somehow, Marius knew they had never left the inspector’s mind.
