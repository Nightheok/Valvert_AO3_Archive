Summary:
From a kinkmeme prompt: "I was thinking about...some version of Valjean in an established relationship who would decide that roleplaying prisoner/guard would be cathartic. / And imagining Javert (as the guard) being totally unable to take it seriously and unable to stop himself from saying the most ridiculous OTT snarky things the whole time, and Valjean getting all frustrated because it's not cathartic if they keep laughing."

Work text:

"Well, what have we here? The notorious 24601, chained to his own bed! How unfortunate!"
"My name is Jean Valjean, sir."
"And I'm Javert. As you know. Heh... Naked, are we?"
"We are, and I don't know why you're talking in the plural. Would you really do that if I were a prisoner?"
"But you are my prisoner, you little tease."
"'Little tease'...? Javert, if you're going to keep making me laugh this won't work at all!"
"On the contrary, my dear, I think it's working very well. Behold, I even brought my mighty baton for you to fear!"
"Javert!"
