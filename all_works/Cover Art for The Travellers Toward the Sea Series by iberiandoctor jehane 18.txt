Another piece of cover art, this one used two of my photos and some interesting tentacle clipart I found using Google. Having moved out of London and having the sea only about 500m from my door I have quite a lot of watery photos to use! If you are interested there is a Les Mis True Type font out there (the original font being Caslon Antique which was digitised by Alan Carr).
