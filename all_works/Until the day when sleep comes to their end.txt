For Georges Pontmercy fluff content


Georges never thought he'd wake up, really. It was a tiresome life he had lived; being scorned by his father-in-law for fighting in the war for France, having only a small cottage in the countryside where he can barely scrape any money in, having the only opportunity to see his son behind holy pillars and wandering eyes, these were the things that he had lived on for the past years of his life. Georges was was not ready to pass on in that way, in a little hut with the remainder of his battle plastered on his forehead and mocking him everyday, far away from his son and the Paris that he had fought for but did nothing for him in return, to be left alone to rot while the elders in the small village mourn him for a few days tops and then forget him, but he had no other choice, with no other person to see him as important or worthy, he really truly did not have anything to live for. 

Or so he thought.

Instead of hearing the rush of gossip from the townsfolks, he hears light breathing and hearts thumping and birds happily singing, instead of feeling the cold and hard surface of wood as a bed, he feels the soft cotton material of a blanket and a pillow over his head that he would so gladly stay in forever, and most of all, instead of standing up with pain on his back and a limp on his leg, he now could not even stand up as a warm large hands pull him close and another interlocking their hands together as if saying that they won't let go now. It was surprising, at first, Georges has never thought that he will experience such things in the past, no one would dare get close to a soldier in the village, and even if they did, it was only for a short good morning before they scurry off. Now, as he observed the two faces that are in deep slumber, now he is able to have pleasures that he has never even dared to imagine in his dreams such as waking up in the morning with a smile on his face and going off to the garden with a full stomach, or reading in the library and having a friendly debate with a former inspector about mercy, hope, law, and everything in between, or simply just seeing his son happy and thriving in this unusual yet welcoming family that they have all created. 

Sure they still have disagreements, things that would boil under the sun and burst before it goes silent, but it will always end with an apology and a new understanding of how they work. It's how life would go on and keep going on, Georges thought to himself as he shook the other men awake with a kiss on the forehead, This may not be perfect, but it is home.
