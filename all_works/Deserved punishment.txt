Javert is a good hunting dog. Numerous people have said so.
His Achilles tendon is slender but strong and athletic, his legs are full of muscle wrapped in a solid skeleton, and his iliac bones are thin and narrow, allowing him to catch thieves with his feet like flying. He is far broader than the average hound, and visually thinner, but actually has extremely strong and elastic fibrous tissue, these muscles work flexibly under his light golden skin over the years, supporting him to capture bandits and hunt down murderers.
Mobility alone is not enough to be a good hunting dog, what makes Javert proud is his sensitive nose. He seemed to have a gift that other colleagues envied - the ability to remember any smell he had smelled or sniffed since he could remember, whether he intended to or not: the wooden box in which his mother kept her fortune-telling bear's teeth, the sour smell of sweat under the cloth shirts of each prisoner in Toulon, the smell of blood under the chains that collided, the musty and salty smell of seawater soaking through the deck, the pungent smell of limes The pungent smell of being squeezed, the smell of straw dried grains, the rotten smell between the teeth of the wolf-breed prisoners, the sour fermented smell of bad wine, the smell of sweat and glands emanating from the confinement cell that was so hot that it was almost boiled, the fishy hot smell that the swollen sex organs of the wolf-breed prisoners could not hide ......
Sha Wei bit his lower lip and turned his attention back. This is a very formal occasion. He reminded himself in his mind. He was about to become the new "sheepdog" of the seaside town, and the mayor of the Pan Sheep, who had a pair of heavy curved horns and large, heavy pupils in his eyes, was about to become his new "master.
He did not know why the memory of Toulon would suddenly come to his door and grab him by the throat. In doubt, he even went out of his way to ask the mayor of the sheep: "Have we met before?" After being swept by the pupils of the stolid sheep and denied by the Mayor's eyelids that did not flutter once, Javert became more and more guilty like the errant puppy. He always keenly erected ears back slightly, the tip of the ear laid flat, as if he had been pointed at the nose scolded, bowed to the mayor formal goodbye.
How could he have such a wrong idea? Javert questioned himself in his mind. It was Toulon, where the carnivorous beasts were imprisoned, and how could he let his nose associate with the sinful wolves in prison when faced with such a respected, heavy woolen, majestic and dignified pan sheep in his stride?
Whenever he was in the same room with the mayor, the face of the sinful wolf who should be rotting in prison came to his mind, but when he covered his mouth and sniffed the air, there was not a trace of sin. He could only smell the odor of a decent gentleman, a heavy and tidy beast, a powerful ram, the odor of tidy straw, rumbling wool yards, sun-dried wood, unadulterated by copper, which only made him respect the mayor more and more.
Javert had to admit that he appreciated the mayor's heavy-skinned majesty, broad shoulders, sunken eyes, and he couldn't forget the mayor's poise when he walked into the room with a slight lift of his hand, his unhurried steadiness under his heavy horns, his aura of prestige when he approached Javert. Javert, as the one with sharp teeth and paws, as the hound that crawls in the marketplace, wanted to submit to the majesty of this powerful herbivore and be his faithful sheepdog, a foolish thought that appeared suddenly but was hard to suppress. He could only try to avoid meeting the mayor's eyes, and when reporting on his mission, he lowered his back more and more respectfully, with his tail tucked between his legs.
However, the mayor did not let him go. The sheep's eyes pressed heavily on his bowed back, like a boulder grinding across the raised bones at the back of his neck, and Javert's tightly corseted neckline couldn't stop the coarseness of the gaze, so he let it trigger a shudder that was suppressed in his uniform. Sha Wei several times want to ask but can not speak, can only shut his mouth and bow his head, sinking deeper into the mayor meaningless reverence and suspicion.
The problem was the moment the mayor lifted the car, even for a sheep in the prime of life, he showed a surprising amount of strength. Once again, Javert couldn't help thinking of a certain sinful wolf with a record of extreme danger written on his file, of his bulging muscles and dripping sweat as he lifted the mast like a dead log, the prison records repeatedly stating that 24601 had unbelievably sharp teeth and claws, reminding the guards to be on their guard. And Javert would never forget the power of those white teeth: the sharp white teeth had left a bloodstain along with the wolf's low barking laugh with just a touch at the side of Javert's suppressed whimpering throat.
He suppressed the false recollection caused by his nose again and went back to write a letter to Chabrier. He had a unique feline grace that Javert both respected and feared, and his unhurried and unhurried demeanor convinced Javert when they first met. Javert still can't believe that Chabrier chose him over the other hounds that day, and in his time away from Toulon, Javert has always followed the teachings of this mentor and friend, including Javert's transfer to this thriving seaside town, which was also the work of Chabrier.
Chabrier's reply arrived soon afterwards, the report of Jean Valjean's arrest from the Parisian police department a sharp blow to Javert's nose, in which Chabrier wrote sharply that Javert should stop thinking about the wolf and focus on the town's prosperity and his own promotion.
Promotion. Yes, promotion. Javert remembered the conversation in Chabrier's study before he left, snuggled up with the smell of wine, perhaps he was destined to disappoint the two majestic officers, the two "masters" in power today. Javert stood in front of the mirror and fed each button into the buttonhole, gazed at his lips and eyes, dressed up and went to the mayor to apologize.
The mayor was shocked by Javert's foolishness, but if he felt the same weight of anger, he did not show it. The good gentleman restrained his words and actions well and did not reprimand his subordinate for a single moment. Yet this gentleness made Javert roll on pins and needles, and his nostrils made the kind of thin sound that is characteristic of a dog's eager plea for an appropriate punishment.
The mayor can not understand this, he is after all a ram, and do not understand the hounds like Sha Wei from a young age will be trained to do what they are told, the inertia of reward and punishment has been soaked into the marrow. Doing the wrong thing is punished, do the right thing is rewarded, captured a habitual thief, a slightly better than usual meal and accompanied by Chabrier "good boy" on the forehead or neck and shoulders of the touch, it is enough to let the Sha Wei tingling, slightly spit tongue intoxicated with the law on the right to defend the justice. And when he does something wrong, a crisp whip, a boot, a chastisement, he deserves it, not to mention the unforgivable mistake of questioning his superiors.
"I will not fire you, the town needs you, go back Inspector." Madeline made the gesture of expulsion, he still looked grave, calm and full of heart, now Javert's ears were completely back to the back of his head, he tore his lower lip with his teeth, not knowing how to get the share of discipline he deserved. He couldn't just walk back to the post, he couldn't eat, patrol and pray without being disciplined. The horrible pain of escaping chastisement would consume him as he lay in bed. He whimpered, pinning his ears and tail, pressing his body lower, even trying to bring his wet nose closer to Madeline's calloused hands, praying for a reprimand and a smack strong enough to hurt for half a month. But Madeline refused to give him any pain.
Madeleine was distracted. Jean Valjean had been captured? Had they captured another wolf similar to themselves? The wolf under the sheep's skin thought with bated breath, wishing only that Javert would leave immediately, taking their trivial past with him, leaving Valjean alone with his conscience for a while. But Javert had never really obeyed him, and the hound of the law suddenly knelt at Jean Valjean's feet, his hands trembling slightly but with a nervous determination, and brought the hand that should have held the baton to the spot where Valjean's genitals were under his cloak. Jean Valjean jumped away as if he had been burned by fire. "What are you doing Javert?!"
"Please ......" Javert's ears went back in that all-submissive, frightened gesture, "please allow me to serve ...... " He sputtered up, this service is hidden, potential, do not need to say the existence of, Sha Wei is not adept at this, however in prison he had also learned how to serve the superior with the mouth and lips, how to wrap sharp sharp teeth, only with lips and tongue to lick. This is only the service that subordinates should do when the noble male superior is in dire need of venting, and sometimes comes with a sign of respect, a symbol of submission. And the nobleman allowed the lowly man like Javert to serve, that is also a proof of trust, far more intimate trust than the sword dropped on the shoulder. This is how Javert understood it. When he knelt before Chabrier's knee, he did not feel dirty or humiliated, it was just a service that included respect. Thus, when the mayor was angry but not on him, and refused to give him a painful whipping, he knelt down.
Jean Valjean could not understand this. His legs trembled and he stepped back, he had never really done many of the things that a man in such a position should do, too simple, too kind, too upright, all these qualities that add to the false identity while making it alien to the class, all made him never see such a dilemma.
What's more, it was Javert kneeling in front of his eyes.
Was Javert whimpering? Was that tiny, puppy-like sound really from Javert? Jean Valjean, in his distress, still had the strength to think about this, how different it was from the Javert he remembered. The cold-faced young jailer sniffed with his nose for any trace of sin, the cold and ruthless embodiment of a prison, that was all Valjean thought of Javert. Yet he would not say that this Javert was all that strange. In that confinement cell, on the night when Javert had been forced into heat by the hormones of a female dog, Valjean still remembered the way he had been forced to kneel under him, trembling like a female dog on his knees to withstand the hard and heavy pounding, the wolf who had not been drugged but had not really given out for years, inflicting all his wickedness on the jailer who prayed for mercy. That was definitely wrong, but he couldn't forget the joy of being circled tightly when he grabbed Javert's long tail and pulled it back, he only had to shake his waist gently, and the cold jailer fell to his knees and trembled with excessive stimulation, to the point where Javert couldn't even support himself on his elbows, his forehead on the ground, panting with his tongue, making a pitiful whimper like a puppy, a sound that would make Valjean sympathize with him when he was calm, but full of The evil Jean Valjean, however, only inflicted heavier and heavier stabbing into his tight little mouth under the wet tail of bodily fluids.
Was it the same with Javert at that time, with his hairy ears back, feeling aggrieved and uncomfortable, bowing forward and praying for relief? Valjean wouldn't say he couldn't remember. The touch and the rhythm of the impact were still in his mind, surfacing now and then in the blank gaps of scripture recitation in the evenings after his prayers. And now Javert, eager and thirsty again, approached the image of the ram he had forged, praying for the opportunity to be served and flogged with his lips and tongue ......
Javert could not control himself whimpering in his throat, not knowing how to get the opportunity to be chastised. Should he suck on the mayor's finger to prove that he can use his lips and tongue properly? Was it because of his foolish appearance that the mayor didn't even bother to take his energy out on him? The shadow of the ram loomed over him again before he was almost disheartened enough to get up and leave to go kneel in church all night to pray for God's chastisement. Madeleine's hand on his shoulder was like a thousand pounds, giving him what Javert had prayed for.
"You can do what you want, but since it is you this eye and this nose that confesses me wrong, close your eyes and hold your breath in my service."
Javert squeezed his eyes shut and knelt with bated breath in front of Madeleine's chair, fumbling with the hem of the heavy cloak. Valjean allowed him to untie it, revealing the wolf's torso. Jean Valjean knew that Javert would not open his eyes or sniff, and that under the weight of the command Javert would swallow him until he could not bear one more ounce. He didn't even try to block the sensitive hound's view with a cloth or something, just sat in his chair and looked down at Javert.
And Javert, even if he closed his eyes, the posture of that majestic ram would still appear in the darkness of his sight. He was serving such a distinguished gentleman. Javert told himself that his slight trembling was all because of this, but even as he swallowed with bated breath, torturing his throat with the unimaginable size of the ram, a whiff of the smell still wafted into his senses. He closed his eyes tightly, the length of Madeleine by imagination to feel simply horrible, yet the shadow of that sinful wolf suddenly intruded into Javert's thoughts, and he suddenly felt in his mouth again that sinful wolf's stuff, with the fishy smell of the prison pressed above the guard's lips, and he had to swallow it in exchange for the sinful wolf to help him with that unspeakable pain in the narrow dark room. When Javert finally swallowed Madeleine into his throat, the tip of his nose was also deep into the hair at the end of the ram's sex organ, the smell of 24601 was suddenly so strong that he gagged. But Javert didn't move a muscle, he pinched his palm, tensed the arch of his foot, ears back, and continued to lick Madeline's burning sex, praying that Mr. Mayor would release him before he made a complete mess.
