It’s foolish, Javert knows, even as he accepts another slice of coconut (and really, isn’t this far different than base camp, and truly, would you look at the clifftops against the setting sun, and don’t they remind you of falling soldiers swathed in blood, and really, how much longer can any of this last?).Captain Brackett sees no issue with the meals (isn’t it nice for the young Commander to relax?  isn’t it useful to whore him out to get information about the island?), and Javert only wishes he could prostrate himself before the man, tell him about the open bedroom door and dismissed servants and loosened cravat, and thus make his superiorship him off in disgrace.The man is never less than courteous (a gracious fox), smooth (if a bit unsure at times), and utterly unknowable (the only part of him Javert shrinks from, for isn’t the unaccountable the true vein of fear?) during their lingering meals, and Javert knows he cannot hold much longer to the threads of duty (oaths), honor (vows), and fortitude (sanity) with this tempting man who speaks his mother tongue living high atop a cliff.
