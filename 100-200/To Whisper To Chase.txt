Whispers in Paris run amok on the streets.

Most of the whispers concern merely gossip - the everyday oh, did you hear? Oh, did you not know?

But one particular whisper runs along the cobbled paths, sneaking into houses, following the gamin of the beautiful city of light around. The gamin walk, from street to avenue to bridge, murmuring to each another.

They say, are you alright? Do your parents accept you? Do you know where to go, where to hide? What if you need to leave, do you know how far they will chase you?

A boy, young in age, looking to be ten (but of course, all children are older than they look), mumbles right back at them, they will go to all lengths. I am their- their son. They want me back, they will find me, for I have nowhere to go.

The gamin whisper among themselves, and visibly, a conclusion is come to. If you fear for your life, they say, when you fear for your life, come to us. Find us around Paris. Tell us to take you to a place with the most delicious madeleines. We hold you dear, we will keep you safe, for you know what us little people can do.

The boy looks up with watery eyes, and nods. The gamin rustle and bustle and congratulate themselves and run off to spread more whispers.
